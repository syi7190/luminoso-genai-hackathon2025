"I recently visited Mejuri and had a great experience! The store has a wide selection of beautiful pieces. The sales associates were incredibly friendly and helpful, offering great advice and making sure I felt comfortable throughout my visit and with my purchases.What really stood out was the piercing studio experience with Dawn (their in house piecer). She was not only knowledgeable but also professional and patient. Dawn gave me personalized ear styling tips, helping me select the perfect placement and jewelry that would complement my other piercings. The piercing studio is very clean and Dawn took great care in ensuring everything was sterile throughout the entire process. She used all the necessary precautions and followed a strict protocol to maintain a clean and safe environment, which made me feel even more confident in her expertise.Overall, I highly recommend Mejuri for both their beautiful jewelry and exceptional piercing experience. Its clear that they take great care in providing a top-notch customer experience! Will be back!",Chestnut Hill,0,2025-02-07 00:00:00,Mejuri,5,"27 Boylston St, Chestnut Hill, MA",MA,Rebecca Gaffney,

"I went to Mejuri chestnut hill today and got my ear pierced by Dawn!! Dawn was amazing and walked me through the whole process so I felt comfortable the whole time. The piercing looks amazing and I am so happy with it. If you ever need to get your ears/ear pierced, I highly recommend Dawn at Mejuri chestnut hill",Chestnut Hill,0,2025-02-09 00:00:00,Mejuri,5,"27 Boylston St, Chestnut Hill, MA",MA,Amanda Reetz,
"Beware, this mostly online retailer has an F rating from the Better Business Bureau. I purchased a pair of their earrings that I later wished I had returned as they were far to too heavy to be comfortable to wear. I tried to post an honest review on their site which strangely never appeared after multiple attempts, making me doubt the validity of their customer product reviews. If you purchase any of their products, I would first visit the store and view in person, rather than going by the reviews. I would also  be sure to save all of the packaging materials in case you are not completely satisfied with the product (which may be likely). Mejuri has not responded on why the website did not accept my review, but did tell me they pass along my product feedback.",Boston,0,2025-01-10 00:00:00,Mejuri,1,"126 Newbury St, Boston, MA",MA,Carolyn Cerva,
We had a lovely experience here at Mejuri on Newbury. The staff were warm and welcoming and helped me pick out a few new earrings to add to my collection.

"I came in to buy some hoops and the person who helped me made me feel very unwelcome. She didnt greet me at all and whenever I asked a question, gave me very short answers which made me feel very rushed. She seemed annoyed the entire time I was there. At the end of the purchase, she walked away without saying anything and went behind the counter so I awkwardly waited where I was until my earrings were ready. Everyone else seemed lovely so either she was having a bad day or I wasnt welcome. Its a shame because I was excited to visit and love the jewelry but I dont think Ill be going here again.",Boston,0,2024-11-10 00:00:00,Mejuri,2,"126 Newbury St, Boston, MA",MA,Christine Byun,
"The ladies working at this location are amazing. It was hard to make a decision because I loved basically everything! The workers here were so patient and answered all of my many questions. I loved that you were able to take a close look at all of the pieces and even try things on.I have been so interested in trying Mejuri for a long time, but because it was all online I never bought anything. This store changed things for me and I will definitely buy again from Mejuri either in person or online.",Boston,0,2024-02-10 00:00:00,Mejuri,5,"126 Newbury St, Boston, MA",MA,Madison DeLacy,
"Came in for an EXCHANGE for a gift worth $100, or for store credit. Went through 3 people in order to find someone who could help me do the exchange (everyone was too busy and told me to wait, which was fine). What was not fine was, finally, when they were helping me, the person REFUNDED to the original payment instead of store credit for an exchange. He even asked me refund to original? with his finger hovering the button, and before I could say NO he pressed it. And then, he told he couldnt undo the refund and told me to ask the original gifter (who is long gone to another country, btw - also do you know how awkward that is??). I obviously did not bother my friend about it again, but this customer service is???",Boston,0,2024-12-10 00:00:00,Mejuri,1,"126 Newbury St, Boston, MA",MA,Ayra Enders,

"I was SO excited to hear Mejuri was opening a store on Newbury. Such a clean and fresh looking store. I had my eye on a pair of earrings (unfortunately not carried in store, but was able to try on other options to get a size reference) and Simone helped me lock in my purchase.

"service was so bad, some of the staff members (including the manager at the time) were so blatantly unhelpful and seemed to have zero knowledge regarding products/services. staff member had to get manager to advise me how to use klarna (which they promote in the store), and manager said ""ive never had a credit card so idk how klarna works"" as her form of assistance. staff members were so monotone and seemed like they didnt want to be there, except for two. i have worked MANY customer service jobs so i didnt want to be a big stickler, but this was just unacceptable. made my friend and i super uncomfortable and peeved, would never come back here again.",Boston,1,2024-02-10 00:00:00,Mejuri,1,"126 Newbury St, Boston, MA",MA,libra dom,

"WARNING:Make sure that they are selling you the correct item!I had a terrible experience at this Newbury St location in Boston. I was looking for a specific item and one of the sales associates tried to sell me something completely different. Thankfully, another associate pointed out that it was the incorrect item. However, when the mistake was pointed out, the first associate shrugged and said eh, its close enough. I was so shocked by the lack of care and customer service, especially considering the high prices of your products.",Boston,2,2023-02-10 00:00:00,Mejuri,1,"126 Newbury St, Boston, MA",MA,Anna Belle Harada,
"I just visited Mejuri and had the worst possible experience. I am a frequent shopper of Van Cleese Arpels and Cartier. I was wearing this when I walked into the shop looking at rings. The woman working there dismissed me as soon as I walked in and said out loud "" use hand sanitizer before and after!!!"". I had not even picked up a piece of jewelry. I asked her to make sure what she knew she was saying because I was so shocked. Then she said it again. I am a VIC at Louis Vuitton and literally was wearing 40k in Cartier. To be treated like trash is beyond me. This place deserves to go down in flames. I get fliers all the time at my high rise apartment asking to visit. This place is trashy just like their associates.

"Easily the worst returns experience Ive ever had. I waited one month for a DHL return driver to come to my house at the dates I provided but they never came on those dates. I had to pay return postage myself using Australia Post only to be told that they wouldnt refund my small return cost, and would charge me another processing fee. I had no choice but to use Australia Post after a month of waiting. Every time I email Mejuri, a different customer experience person would respond who didnt seem to have read the whole email thread. As a result of shopping with Mejuri, Im out of pocket and have had my time wasted. I would not recommend.",Brooklyn,0,2025-01-10 00:00:00,Mejuri,1,"107 N 6th St, Brooklyn, NY",NY,Stephanie Goodlad,

I love shopping at Mejuri online to get my wife necklaces and bracelets so we were excited to shop in store for the first time. Its a real shame that the whole duration no one helped us at all while the employee kept asking everyone else if they have been helped out yet.

"Not to throw shade at the brand, I use Mejuri jewelry for some of my everyday accessories, meaning this was not my first time shopping from the brand, so I came in knowing exactly what I wanted. At first the young woman who asked me what I was looking for seemed like she was not in the mood for working. Without even making an effort to check, she first said that the earrings I wanted were not available in-store. Right after I said Ok, I guess Ill just make my purchase online she magically remembered they were in stock in the back room! The whole 5 minutes I was there she acted as if she was doing me a favor.

"I randomly walked by and saw a sign that stated Mejuri had piercing services. Despite it being 7:30 pm on a cold Monday night, I walked in and was greeted warmly by staff. I inquired about their piercing services. My intention was to obtain info about their services and come back another day to get my tragus lobe pierced. I was ultimately introduced to the piercer, Mo. Mo was great!! She was friendly and professional. Based off of her vibe, I made the spontaneous decision to pierce my tragus on the spot. Mo did it in a fashion that barely caused any pain/discomfort. I loved the piercing instantly!!  Im already trying to adjust my schedule to confirm a second piercing appointment with Mo before the month is over.",New York,0,2025-01-20 00:00:00,Mejuri,5,"144 5th Ave, New York, NY",NY,Martina R.,
"Horrible exchange policy. Was given a gift and was not allowed to exchange it (for a more expensive item I was going to pay for) because it was outside of the 30 days.

"I really dont write reviews but I was extremely shocked and unimpressed by how I was treated at this location. Im going to make this VERY clear that I work within the retail sector and have been for 10+ years, WITH experience in jewelry, so I know what great CX is supposed to look like.Firstly, I was made to feel like I wasnt wanted in the store. I came in with high intent to purchase (and I did), but not a single associate greeted me, or asked me for help as I was visibly browsing. I had to flag an employee to discuss the earring selection.She was ""kind"", but was also speaking to me as if I couldnt afford a $500.00 pair of solid gold hoops? Very insulting, because it wasnt once, it was multiple times I was spoken to in a condescending manner about price range. THAT truly spoiled the experience, and because of that Ill either shop online or never again with the brand.If I came in with the intention to buy real gold hoops, that was going to be a sale you lost because of how I was spoken to. Do better, and treat every single customer with the same courtesy.The singular star is because I love my earrings and am happy with my purchase, but I think Ill continue to support the mom and pop shops that are the real purveyors of the NYC jewelry scene.",New York,0,2024-09-10 00:00:00,Mejuri,1,"144 5th Ave, New York, NY",NY,Jessica Taylor,

"I would not recommend Mejuri wedding bands.Goodbye Mejuri, it was nice while it lasted.Id bought rings at Mejuri before (Spring St location- they were lovely) and figured it would be a good place to get my wedding bands. I went to the Williamsburg location, where they didnt have the sizes we needed in stock, so we had them shipped to our home. The first red flag here is that we were told a signature would be required for delivery, but the rings were just left in our lobby. Glad I worked from home that day so I could pick them up quickly, but the package could have easily been stolen.After trying the ring on for a little longer, my partner realized that he needed a smaller size. My office is a block away from the Flatiron Mejuri location, so we stopped in around lunch on a weekday, in the hopes we could do a quick exchange. Everyone on the floor was busy when we walked in, so we posted up by the wedding bands to wait for somebody to be free.We waited for at least 10 minutes without as much as a hello. I made eye contact with a salesperson and she, seeming surprised, asked oh, do you need assistance?. Oof, second red flag. Maam, maybe I do look poor, but I thought we were living in a post-Pretty-Woman society, where I was allowed to shop while frumpy.I asked if we could exchange my partners ring for a smaller size, and possibly mine for a thinner one. The vibe was icy and skeptical. The rings were taken back and reviewed-- mine had multiple scratches and could not be exchanged. Fair, whatever. My partners had one small scratch and could not be exchanged. What? They admitted that it might have just been sold to us that way, but we would have to return to the Williamsburg location and try our luck there.Maybe its just because Im in my thirties now, but I truly want to get serious about my jewelry, which means having a relationship with a jeweler I feel comfortable with and who can back up their pieces or like... resize them at least. Mejuri is not that. Come here for a cute trendy piece (and dress the part if you dont want to be ignored).

"Horrible Experience at this location. When I asked to check if the earring placements are ok, he was extremely curt and didnt want to show me which areas I can place the earring on.I have previously gotten pierced at Maria Tash and the experience was much better.Here the piercer didnt show me if the needles are sterilized, if the jewelry is sterilized and he was clearly annoyed when I asked to move the placement.This type of service for piercing is unacceptable. If the appointments are 20 mins only, they should tell people to show up early to select jewelry. Piercing is a permanent modification. Rushing someone through it is extremely unprofessional and makes the customer feel really unhappy. I literally walked away feeling that I was shooed away.Also to add, I got my cartilage piercing first and got my lobe done after, and idk what happened but he applied so much force on the lobe one it was hurting a lot. This is my 5th piercing and Ive never had anyone push the needle in with so much force on the lobe piercing.Honestly I was extremely unhappy with how the appointment went.So not recommended at all, please book somewhere else.",New York,0,2024-11-10 00:00:00,Mejuri,1,"144 5th Ave, New York, NY",NY,Shalini Vijay,

"I received no assistance from the staff upon entering the store. It was challenging to determine who was an employee, so I had to take some time to observe the situation before seeking help. I was drawn to the Zodiac necklace and inquired about trying on my zodiac sign, but the salesperson directed me to the display, claiming they were identical, which was not the case. Despite the discrepancy, I was still fond of the style and expressed my intention to purchase it. Retrieving the item from the storage area took an unexpectedly long time. Upon returning home, I discovered that I had been given the incorrect necklace. The email receipt showed the correct item, but the one in my possession was different.

I originally went in for an oxidized sterling silver cuff bracelets trial but after exploring my options I ended up walking out with an Onyx sterling silver ring and a minimalistic bracelet.I am a person who is all about comfort and personalized service and Mejuri left me wanting more:definitely a recommendation from my end and I will be visiting Gabby shortly for more of her amazing recommendations.",New York,0,2024-08-10 00:00:00,Mejuri,5,"43 Spring St, New York, NY",NY,Syed Ishmum,
I got a necklace gifted to me for my birthday and within 3 days it broke. I brought it in with the order receipt and was allowed to trade it in for a new one because of the warranty. However they didnt have the necklace and had to ship it to me (I am visiting NYC and live in California) and I had to ship it to California because I dont live here. They still had to charge me and I had to pay for THEIR broken necklace that was MY birthday gift. Very disappointed in this customer service. You would think that given their quality of product that they would cover such a thing because the damage is their fault. They couldnt even try to find if a different location here might have it in stock??????Will probably not shop again because of this service and will definitely warn my friends based on this.,New York,0,2024-11-10 00:00:00,Mejuri,2,"43 Spring St, New York, NY",NY,Danielle Liu,
"Security guard was being really extra and overbearing when we were just trying on some bracelets for size because my friends wrist is really small.

Came in there ready to buy but they didnt make it any easier or comfortable. My friend bought a $300 necklace but they were treating us as if we came there to steal.

"Avoid. If you dont avoid... only buy in the store, and only buy something you know you will absolutely not need to return.They sent me earrings that apparently had tiny scratches on them that were not visible to the naked eye. I took them out of their bag only to try them on, realize I didnt like them (they were so heavy that they were stretching out my ear holes and it was uncomfortable) and I put them right back in the bag.  When I tried to return them, THIS is apparently when the earrings were thoroughly inspected with a microscope. (Not before I purchased them.) They did not accept the return because of scratches, which I know with 100% certainty I did not cause. I also could not see any scratches on the earrings when the associate in the store was trying to show me. So make of that what you will.I was offered store credit instead of a refund, which is better than nothing, but I still feel taken advantage of. And Im not super excited to use my store credit, because based on this (if the scratches were even real) and based on other reviews, it seems like there is a quality problem with the jewelry from Mejuri which the company shows no interest in taking responsibility for once a purchase has taken place. Its really a shame, because the designs are beautiful.Edit for fairness:I was provided with a refund to my payment method after the company noticed my review.",New York,0,2024-08-10 00:00:00,Mejuri,1,"43 Spring St, New York, NY",NY,Sarah McConkey,

"This is the first review Ive ever left online, but I was truly disappointed with my experience today. Went by the Soho location this evening, to pick up an order that Id purchased online during the Black Friday sale. I specifically chose to pick up in store so that I could discuss styling options with the staff - I really hoped for some suggestions on curating a pretty ""earring stack"", something Mejuri advertises all over its website and social media. I spent $1200 on 14k gold pieces, (which is a big investment for me) and even intended to grab a few more items during my visit. Most of the staff members were friendly, and the store itself was aesthetically quite pleasing, which is why Im leaving 2 stars instead of 1. That said, the piercer on duty was honestly really, really rude. Each time I asked him for his insight, he would very flatly respond with something along the lines of ""its all personal preference"", and his tone, body language, and facial expressions all came across as condescending and judgmental, like he thought I was a waste of his time, as well as an idiot for not knowing exactly what I wanted and where. I honestly felt really embarrassed and uncomfortable. Instead of leaving with more pieces, I returned everything that I purchased. This whole experience really turned me off from Mejuri, and Ill be taking my money elsewhere, unfortunately.",New York,0,2024-12-10 00:00:00,Mejuri,2,"43 Spring St, New York, NY",NY,Madison Watson,
"I bought a ring recently from Mejuri, but when it was delivered, I realized I had ordered the wrong size. I only tried the ring on once and immediately put it back in the box to return it.However, after they received the return, I was only issued store credit instead of a full refund.When I contacted customer service, they claimed the ring had scratches, which is completely false. I know for certain that I did not scratch the ring, as I barely handled it. It feels like Mejuri is unfairly trying to avoid honoring their return policy by shifting the blame onto customers, which is extremely disappointing.Ill never order from them again.I recommend thinking twice before purchasing from Mejuri if you expect fair treatment with returns.",New York,0,2024-11-10 00:00:00,Mejuri,1,"43 Spring St, New York, NY",NY,Volha Radzko,
Both employee and manager refused to accept cash as a form of payment  - which is illegal in NYC as of 2020.

"I lost my diamond tennis bracelet in June (clasp opened and slipped off my wrist). Devastated, I called the store, assuming that nothing could be done (not Mejuris fault!) however much to my surprise and delight the manager agreed to replace it free of charge, sending me a brand new one. As it was back-ordered, they told me it would arrive in August. It arrived yesterday (July) and I was elated! Only minor problem now was the reverse, whereas the clasp before was too loose (bracelet fell off) this new one had a super secure one, so secure that I couldnt take it off! I went to the store and it had a different open/close mechanism, but the store clerk recognized how difficult it was and offered to get me a THIRD bracelet, so that it would be perfect. Incredible above and beyond service, and I am over the moon that Mejuri replaced the first bracelet, and now again the second, as the clasp wasnt totally perfect. Truly wow-worthy service and Ive been shouting my story from the rooftops as Im so impressed with the brand!

"This Mejuri location does not accept cash, which is not only an illegal and finable offense in New York City, but also a practice that discriminates against the socioeconomically disadvantaged, particularly communities of color. Even people without a credit or debit card should be able to treat their sweetie to a $38 pair of earrings if they so choose, so I was very disappointed when the clerk told me they would not take my cash. I am considering filing a formal complaint with the city, and urge any other customers who care about their poor brothers and sisters to do the same by searching NYC Cash Payment Refusal in their browser.",New York,0,2024-09-10 00:00:00,Mejuri,1,"43 Spring St, New York, NY",NY,Adrian Rew,

I usually dont write a review. I have to write this because I am soo disappointed. I bought 3 earrings from Mejuri. One earring started to turn all black and the other one is peeling off.I think H&M jewelry are better quality than Mejuri atleast they dont turn black so quick.I really love their designs but sadly all my earrings are peeling off and turning black.VERY VERY POOR QUALITY !,New York,0,2024-07-10 00:00:00,Mejuri,1,"43 Spring St, New York, NY",NY,Susan Sherpa,
"DO NOT GET PIERCED HERE.I usually go to tattoo/piercing parlors but got a tragus piercing here because my sister wanted to get something done together. I completely regret coming here because now I have an infected tragus piercing.One, I dont think mejuri focuses on the actual healing process of a piercing (focuses on aesthetic instead) and doesnt do well with informing the client what can/cant be done. Ive gotten several cartilage piercings before and the piercer inserted a bar thats WAY too short for my tragus (left no room for swelling/healing). Because of this, my piercing has consistently been infected and has a keloid despite how much I clean it and avoid laying on it.Not only that, but I found the piercers provided basically no after care besides some QR pamphlet...which I found embarrassing. I cant imagine if youre someone who has no experience with piercings and your piercer doesnt even educate you on after-care. Luckily I have experience with piercings so I know the protocol; but every other piercer Ive been at has always done a through aftercare with the client letting them know what to do. Also, usually they have saline solution you can purchase to clean the piercing (mejuri does not offer that...and I consider that pretty standard for a piercer to have on hand for clients).Maybe if youre only buying jewelry, come here.Otherwise youll just leave with an infected ear and to be out $200-$300. Go to a proper parlor and itll only cost $20-$60 for a piercing.",New York,2,2024-02-10 00:00:00,Mejuri,1,"43 Spring St, New York, NY",NY,Kim,
"I visited the store for a last-minute errand to purchase my partner a ring for our anniversary. I was greeted by a sales associate named Sarah. I asked for her opinion on their rings based on my budget. She swiftly took out all the different options that I may like. I was very indecisive, but she was patient and accommodating throughout the whole process. I finally decided on a ring, and she was kind enough to include a small discount since it was a little over budget. She also took the time to educate me on the product and how to maintain it.

It is a pink color. This we cant even exchange because it is past the 2 year warranty.I will no longer be buying from this company and used to love it. The quality is pretty awful now.

"I booked an appointment to have my ears pierced. I initially planned to get three piercings. However, after consulting with Mike (the piercer if thats an actual titled?) he informed me that the style I wanted required an earring size that is not sold by the company. He then immediately recommended a tattoo parlor close by that could do the style for me. I really appreciated his honesty. He could have tried to sell me an earring style that would have been ""close enough"" in size but he was honest in saying none of them were the proper size for what I wanted and  I appreciated that. He took time with me for a mini consultation and was very patient as I had to reorganize my thoughts and decide on what I wanted given I was unable to achieve the style I originally booked the appointment for. He was very kind and very professional. He made my experience so enjoyable and I will definitely return for future piercings. In addition, I purchased a bracelet which I scouted out on the website prior to coming in-store. The sales associates were nice and attentive. My shopping experience was great.

"I used to shop at the Mejuri SOHO store pre-pandemic, and the service used to be fabulous!Ever since the pandemic, the level of service seems to go down a bit more every time I returned. I visited the SOHO store today 8/24/2023 at around 2:30pm. At the time, there were less than a total of 10 people in the store. I was browsing the 14k solid gold counter, where a sales associate was positioned, she was at the time not servicing other customers.For the 2-3 min while I walked around the counter, clearly interested in making a purchase, not only did she not budge from her spot at the counter, she had ZERO intentions to even drop a simple ""hello"" or ""welcome"".When I used to come to the store, the sales associate would help to sanitize the pieces that I wanted to try, so when I asked where I can find the sanitizing swabs, she made a snarky comment and said ""theyre all cleaned."" I wasnt about to take her word for it, so then I asked politely where I could get some swabs to do it myself. She pointed ""somewhere"" to the middle of the counter and said, its all in there. It took me a good 5 seconds to see and realize that she was pointing to a covered marble cup holder in the middle of the counter, but she couldnt be bothered to even help me grab it or to even clearly indicate what she was referring to.I also asked her about the product that I was looking for. After telling me that they didnt have it in stock, I asked her for something comparable, where she then answered ""Im not sure whats the most similar piece."" I tried the product and despite liking it, I wanted to leave and order online so that I didnt have to deal with the unacceptable level of customer service that I received.The irony of this whole experience was that, as I was leaving the store, the security guard at the front of the door said to me ""have a nice day!"" I honestly think the security guard wouldve been a more fit salesperson and the associates actually working there.As a fellow Canadian, I love supporting domestic brands. But between competitor brands like Kinn Studio, Aurate, Catbird and others, the level of service is just inexcusable.Will also be sending a review to your media accounts.",New York,7,2024-02-10 00:00:00,Mejuri,1,"43 Spring St, New York, NY",NY,Helen T.,

"Mejuri markets itself as high quality for lower prices.Cons:(1) Images online are NOT always reflective of the piece in-person -- for example, a necklace I ordered had a lobster clasp in its online product photo, but when I received it it was a spring ring (lobster clasps are better and easier to use)(2) they are a good value if you compare them to a luxury designer like Tiffany or Cartier obviously, but they are notably more expensive per gold weight than their actual peer competitors like Quince.(3) They are a retail store more than a jewelry store, as in they dont have jewelers in-store or repair any of their pieces. Which is fine, but their employees can only provide very basic jewelry guidance.(4) Customer service is mixed. I ordered an item on 11/28/22 which made it eligible for the 60-day holiday return policy (normally its 30 days), although it was backordered, and then further delayed so I only received it in the mail on 2/9/23. I went in-store to return it only 2 weeks later after receiving it, however the employee gave me a hard time insisting that it was beyond the 30 day window and that she would ask the manager for a one-time exception. However, its returnable for 60 days (normally 30 days) from the date of delivery (confirmed with customer service online). I tried to explain this but employee was reeaally insistent and was acting like she was doing me a huge favor by making a one-time exceptionPros:(1) Their social media customer service seems pretty decent. They quickly clarified their 60-day holiday return policy and that it begins from the date of receiving the item.(2) In-store you can just grab and try-on whatever items, so you can try on basically all their store items pretty quickly (vs. requiring an employee to let you try one item on at a time which takes forever). Lots of seating for the waiting boyfriends/shopping partners too.I have no experience regarding their warranty.

"I have been buying from Mejuri for a few years now and really like their jewelry.That said, I recently made my first couple visits to the store and have been disappointed with the experience around order pick-up.

At my second, I waited 15 minutes, and 2 different people who I watched check in after me had their names called first. I also saw someone decide to buy a new item, pay for it, and get it packaged up all in the span of time that I waited. In both cases I was just buying a single necklace, nothing complicated. My expectation around pickup is that, since I got an email saying my order was ""ready"", it should be all packaged up and ready to go and handing it off to me should just be a matter of grabbing the right bag and not take 15-20 minutes each time. At this point it seems like Id be better off just buying items in-store and not bothering with the advance order and pickup.The employees have all been super nice and Im sure they are doing their best but it seems like the pickup process is flawed and/or they are really understaffed.",New York,1,2023-02-10 00:00:00,Mejuri,3,"43 Spring St, New York, NY",NY,Kaitlin Mahar,

"TLDR:Poor service. Spend your money where you are treated with respect.Context:I visited the Mejuri store on Spring St. to purchase two items. When I entered I immediately asked for the pieces I wanted to purchase, a pair of sterling silver earrings and an ear cuff, to try on. As I tried on the items, I asked a question regarding the dullness of the pieces and if polishing them would help them appear shiner. The associate was unsure and provided a piss-poor response making no attempt to seek assistance from a more knowledgeable staff member or her manager. As I continued trying on the pieces, I overheard the the associate and her co-worker talking about me, not to mention the associate who was supposed to be helping me and instead was commenting on my weird question, did so in a mirror that I could see and easily read her lips in (genius, she is not!)After overhearing the conversation I put the items down and started to leave. However, as I was still upset, I returned to the store and complained to the manager. The manager was apologetic of course, but honestly, how am I expected to believe anything coming from her if your employee is so emboldened to talk about the customer theyre serving the middle of a transaction. To me, this speaks to the culture of the store and tells me that this is acceptable behavior. I have worked in several customer-facing roles, retail and otherwise, and would never had dreamed of talking about a customer in their face unless I thought this was acceptable practice. Without a shred of doubt, I can tell you I would never shop at this location again.If you do venture into this location, avoid the associate who helped me at all cost. I dont know her name, however, she is white, very pale, wears glasses, has about 8 inches of new growth with green, dry looking ends, and an affinity for white culottes.",New York,8,2023-02-10 00:00:00,Mejuri,1,"43 Spring St, New York, NY",NY,Ashley Fullard,

"After repeated difficulty making a return online (they didnt send an invoice first, then wrong shipping label, then wrong instructions), we decided to make a return in person at this location. When we arrived, there was a long line  (easily over an hour) and the door person initially said we wouldnt have to wait if we were just doing a return. After telling her we did not plan on browsing, she told us to wait on the shopping line for her to call us in for the return. After waiting for 40 minutes on the line, I asked another worker and she let us off the line and finally helped us.Absolutely horrible customer service experience (online and in store) and will not be shopping this brand again. Its a shame because their stuff seems nice, but I would definitely rather shop somewhere else that treats customers better.",New York,9,2022-02-10 00:00:00,Mejuri,1,"43 Spring St, New York, NY",NY,Kimberly Lee,
"I own many mejuri pieces. Never had a problem. Excellent service until recently. I placed a Christmas order December 1st. Was informed the next day, due to the holidays my order would be shipping December 16th. No problem.It is December 21st and I get an email TODAY stating there was a glitch in their system and my item is actually out of stock. They have refunded the order. Not only is this beyond frustrating to now have to search for a gift super last minute when I work until Christmas even 8pm… I attempt to purchase another item instead (costs twice as much but its fine because its worth it).I ask for assistance in getting the expedited shipping (cost $15 but its ok bc again its worth it) and they tell me I cannot. It was an option for me to click on but I wasnt able to go back to fix it after that order was processed.They basically try to shut me up and tell me theyll give me $20 credit to my account (my order cost $550.) You can keep your $20. This is unacceptable. You have lost a valuable customer.",New York,1,2023-02-10 00:00:00,Mejuri,1,"43 Spring St, New York, NY",NY,Nadia Rodriguez,

I am not surprised that others believe they are being racially profiled while shopping. This experience has turned me away from the brand, will no longer be shopping here.

Bought a bracelet first . No pb. Then bought a necklace. The gold plated faded away real fast 😥 without wearing it for showers or sport.

I bought 3 bracelets and a ring (all vermeil), and only the ring had to be shipped. Sales staff were friendly and helpful. All of their jewelry was really pretty. Nice experience. The store is small and was very busy and so I had to wait in line outside on a cold day.

"I would never shop here again. If you ever have to return anything, good luck. Horrible ethics and customer service. I returned a pair of brand new earrings in store on 11/5  and its 11/19 a WHOLE 2 weeks later and the funds still havent hit my account. I contacted CS several times and yesterday one person finally said Ive initiated the return which makes no sense because now do I have to wait an extra supposed 5-10 business days which they claim is the routine time on top of the 2 weeks? NO other business takes this long to refund money. I shopped at major brands and the refund literally returns the same day if not the next day or 48 hours max. Ive complained to BBB but they need to fix this ASAP. Of course CS will now reach out and give me the same run around.

"I came here two days ago with a friend who was exchanging an item. Service was great, the person who greeted us at the door was sweet and even at one point picked up a ring I clumsily dropped. The person attending to my friend was also very nice! My problem lies with who im assuming is security, he was very unfriendly and followed us throughout the shop from the moment we entered. He was so blatant that he graduated from giving me and my friend looks and hovering near where we would stand to actually go behind the counter and stand almost directly in front of us even though I am assuming he was not selling jewelry. We made direct eye contact and it was then when he finally decided to move but he was staring  at me the whole time. I still do not understand why he did that because even if it was a concern for theft I was directly in front of a sales associate my entire visit except for when my friend and I moved location in the store because we felt so uncomfortable with his behavior. This was the most blatant profiling I have experienced, and based on previous reviews  it seems like he does this often.My friend loves the jewelry here and always constantly raves about it, it was my first time in this store and although majority of the employees here were sweet my experience with the security was so off putting that I doubt I will ever come back.",New York,4,2023-02-10 00:00:00,Mejuri,1,"43 Spring St, New York, NY",NY,Lov,
"I have been obsessed with Mejuri since the brand first hit the scene, and even more since they opened their doors! Usually when I visit I am greeted with bubbly faces and kindness, however, this past weekend (Saturday), I had a completely different experience. The store was packed and busy and the associates were helping as many people as they could, yet the harshness and cold demeanor of the store manager (Dani - I asked for her name) was extremely off putting. I have visited the store a couple of times now and have come familiar with the associates there, but this time around the manager who I was dealing with couldnt give me more than 2 seconds of her time. Within 2 minutes of our time together, she left me and the questions I had hanging and assisted another woman who walked in after me. Thankfully I was able to finish my shopping experience quickly and leave without more interruption.

"I used to love this brand, I still love their products--but the customer service and overall terrible experience at the Spring St. location has unfortunately left me unable to support this brand. They are so incredibly rude, often acting annoyed that I dare want to spend my money there. Today, I went in with my fiance to look for wedding bands, as we were shopping I asked to try on some rings--the woman behind the counter rolled her eyes and was like ok, sure. Right after I tried on a ring, another woman ran up to the lady who was in front us saying she should never leave the product out--like I am sitting here, trying on rings to buy and the staff act annoyed and only care to make moves if rings are left out in front of people who are actually trying to buy the rings. Ughs, just terrible. Ive never been made to feel like such a burden for wanting to spend so much of my money at an establishment. Terrible vibes, terrible customer service. Give your money to nicer people elsewhere--we ended up stopping by a place in Hoboken on our way home. She greeted us with joy, offered us beverages and was thrilled that we wanted to potentially spend our money with her. We did, we bought both rings and left feeling good and excited. Avoid Mejuri if you can, you will be sad at how terrible a place can be with such lovely jewelry.

"I decided to try Mejuri after reading the stellar reviews. I was disappointed every step of the way. It appears to be a great business model, but is very poorly executed. I visited the store on Spring St in NY. Only half the staff seemed somewhat interested in helping. I stood at a counter looking at pieces and asking questions, the lady there barely glanced up from whatever she was doing on her iPad. I placed my order, was told the order would arrive in a day and they would notify me to pick it up. I received a DHL notification in exactly 1 day that it had been delivered to the store. 8 days later nobody had contacted me. After I contacted them they asked me to pick up my order. The pieces were stacked in a way that the staff didnt seem to know where they were and after taking everything apart, I found my pieces and couldnt wait to get out.

As of this post all three necklaces have turned brown. None of my other jewelry ever changed color except the ones from Mejuri. I am extremely careful with my jewelry. Always kept them out of the sun, never have them touch water or anything else and kept them safely stowed away in their pouches. I was so upset I didnt discover this was a issue with Mejuri  jewelry.

"This one star review is specially for their VERMEIL collection. Disclaimer I love their styles and designs but their vermeil products needless to stay is not worth with the price point we are paying. I own several of the gold pieces and some occasion Ive gifted them to my friends and highly recommended it. But last year, I decided to purchase their vermeil collection as the design I.e. dome croissant come to my liking however after one year in and suddenly one day when I opened my jewelry box I found the pieces in discolored form completely turned blue-purpleish. I got so worried and looked up their company warranty policy and was glad to see that product was under it. But was sad to find out about when their customer service told me that it doesnt qualify under accidents scenario, when I honestly told them that it mightve came in contact with hand sanitizer as in todays situation which is so difficult to avoid. However, with my constant afford to restore my pieces they finally agreed to send me a LITERALLY a 2X2 inch polishing cloth. It did the job but I am so disappointed and even regretted purchasing their vermeil piece as I expected the quality could have been much higher with the price point we paying so it wont be easily discolored or tarnished 😔 As it almost loosing my faith in their pieces and sort of drifting me away in making future purchases from them.",New York,8,2022-02-10 00:00:00,Mejuri,1,"43 Spring St, New York, NY",NY,T.

Lovely jewelry but skip the SoHo store — there is a long line to get in and after you purchase something theyll ask you to wait outside (took ~10 minutes) while they get it from the back. On a super hot summer day (and also trash day no less) its not an ideal experience as a paying customer to stand outside next to a pile of steaming trash after you spent hundreds of dollars in the store. Surely they could have a waiting area inside. Ill order online next time.,New York,8,2022-02-10 00:00:00,Mejuri,3,"43 Spring St, New York, NY",NY,Katie Novy,
The store is lovely and the jewelry is beautiful. Im not sure if only 1 staff is allowed to be at each counter but when I was there I was looking for earrings. The counter where they were at already had 2 other customers and another 2-3 came after me. The girl was very nice and trying to help everyone. However there was another staff right across on a counter that had no customers at all. Perhaps it would have been best to have her come over to help. I understand you dont want to leave an open counter with jewelry unattended but there should be a better system for helping customers.

"I found this store be extremely unprofessional. I understand having to limit the amount of people coming into the store due to Covid -19, but I waited for 30 minutes in line outside, and the sales team mentioned they close the doors ten minutes early in order to give the people shopping time to wrap up. I got called to come in at exactly 6:50 and the sales associate stopped me to say "" sorry were closed""  meanwhile, there was only 3 people left in the store with multiple sales associates standing around talking while there was a line of at least 15 people outside ready to purchase.  As someone that works in a retail environment, there is nothing worse then turning people away when there is available staff to help and money to be spent.

When I mentioned this at the store I was told it was on the website, and later found it located deep within the store directories.A 5 minute grace period is not unheard of in NYC, but should be mentioned and reiterated in every reminder email.

The piercer explained the whole process, showed me where he was going to place the studs and then he pierced each ear. It was over in like 10 minutes. I definitely plan on going back! And my earrings (a star stud and a moon stud) are amazing!",New York,1,2021-02-10 00:00:00,Mejuri,5,"43 Spring St, New York, NY",NY,Shanelle Rein,
Had my ear pierced and it was awesome! You have to get there 30 mins before they open to get a spot or youll have to wait a while. I picked the diamond flower stud and its gorgeous! The place was packed and I wished it was a little bigger. After the piercing I bought a necklace and a ring.,New York,0,2020-02-10 00:00:00,Mejuri,5,"43 Spring St, New York, NY",NY,Van D,
What a surprise to discover Mejuri has a brick and mortar store!  So pleasantly surprised to be able to try on rings that Ive been eyeing on their website.  The sales associate was super helpful and patient with me.  I was even more surprised to be told that they have a store in SF!

"I had a great experience at the store. There was a wide selection of jewelries to try on and it was good to see the jewelries in person because trying it on is very different from seeing pictures online. The store is only for trying on jewelries and you cannot purchase the jewelries themselves. But they offer free expedited shipping if you order in store, so thats another perk for going in.",New York,0,2020-02-10 00:00:00,Mejuri,5,"43 Spring St, New York, NY",NY,Lilla Lee,
"First, my original necklace order didnt even come with the necklace so I had to text and email you guys to send the correct product. Secondly, the necklace that Mejuri sent afterwards came jumbled in a bag so tangled up I cant even get the knot out of it now. I just spent the past 2 hours trying to unknot it but its so dainty its impossible. Is this a joke? By far the worst online jewelry shopping experience Ive encountered yet.",New York,4,2022-02-10 00:00:00,Mejuri,1,"43 Spring St, New York, NY",NY,heydeki,
"I was excited to go into the showroom but upon entering, one girl greeted me but that was about it. I was planning on purchasing some earrings but felt ignored, no one else was in the store, I could have been easily helped/assisted to choose the perfect earrings for me but nothing. Maybe because Im asian?? idk. The vibes were just off.

"The Mejuri showroom represents the functional yet aesthetically pleasing experience of an actual showroom.

First of all, they packed wrong earrings for my boyfriend at the store, which are by the way cheaper $150, but not a biggie he went back and exchanged for the one that he payed for.

The manager at the store should be fired for the way he speaks to customers. Truly an astonishingly rude and unfriendly person. Needs to be address. Also before he rudely dismissed us at the door for coming early he told the lady before us to essentially polish the damaged ring she received herself.

"Bought several gold vermeil items from them last year. Stored them away in the pouches, just like instructed. Each piece was waiting for their day In the limelight due to covid/ nowhere to wear them last year . Took them out today and every single piece is tarnished!!!  Covered in black/ brown spots! None of these pieces were ever worn before and safely stowed away. Attempted to clean by buffing gently with dry cloth like instructions said to no avail. So disappointed because they are such nice items but now unwearable. Waste of money!!!!!

"Had an amazing one on one stylist experience at Mejuri ! I booked the one on one because I know how crazy the store can get, and I was hoping to sit down with someone to find my wedding band. I looked at the website before my appointment so I had some ideas in mind. When my fiancé and I arrived they had everything prepared, including the styles I liked and some refreshments. One of the styles I picked ended up being the winner. I loved being able to try it on in person and see how it looked with my engagement ring (which is a family heirloom btw!) My fiancé and I left thrilled that I found my winning wedding band, and to our surprise it arrived about a day and a half later at my house. Cant wait to purchase some other jewelry from Mejuri in the future. Who knows, maybe Ill find some wedding earrings too. This was my first purchase from Mejuri by the way, and I will be back for more !",New York,1,2020-02-10 00:00:00,Mejuri,5,"43 Spring St, New York, NY",NY,Alicia L,

"FYI this is is just a showroom for now. So you wont be able to WALK AWAY with any jewelry. If you order to store, it will come in 1-2 business days. If you order to home, it will come another 1-2 days after that.For a dainty gold fiend like myself, I spent way too much time trying everything on three times. Its really nice that you can just walk up to a piece and put it on:earrings, rings, bracelets, anklets. Every employee has the price and material memorized for each piece and iPads are available for you to scroll through as well. SOME pieces are not in store to try on but the employees know them well so they can give their opinion.The whole showroom has a wedding registry vibe with nice sofas, a little nook to sit down and make your orders, etc. There is also a piercing studio if you want to get a purchased stud put in (unclear how that works since they dont sell items there).",New York,0,2020-02-10 00:00:00,Mejuri,5,"43 Spring St, New York, NY",NY,Neiki Ullah,
"Doorman made us wait outside immediately after letting two girls out claiming they were ""at capacity"" It was about 10 degrees outside. Also they werent at capacity - like I said, the doorman had just let two people out. We watched them come out and still had to stand out there, in the cold. Happy to wait, but maybe when its less than 10 degrees, have us wait inside.Everyone in the store was lovely, very helpful, and the jewelry is beautiful.

"Product line is great and staff are extremely helpful and courteous.   However, the place needs to get their payment system in order.  They must use a canadian payment processor so US CCs get declined all the time.  Reason being when you make a purchase it alerts your CC company as if someone possibly stole your card and is trying to use it in Canada.   My capital one got declined 5 times and finally had to use my debit  card and forgo the points (btw it would have been ALOT of points)",New York,0,2020-02-10 00:00:00,Mejuri,4,"43 Spring St, New York, NY",NY,Mike Swenson,

"I bought the Diamond Necklace ($298) for my girlfriend to match a ring that she has.  She tried it on when I brought it home, and the chain broke while she went to remove it.  Literally immediately.  Clearly, there was a defect in the chain, because she didnt pull at it, didnt get stuck on clothing or hair, it just fell apart.  She immediately submitted a customer service claim (which purports to respond within 24 hours).  After 6 days, they finally responded and said that they will not be honoring the Warranty Policy because either:1. the claim is outside the two year period (false), 2. the item is lost and not in our possession (false), incorrect materialcare was provided to the piece (false, it was just taken out of the box), normal wear and tear such as scratching or bent (also false, again, it was just taken out of the box), or a third-party vendor was used to repair the item (again, it was just taken out of the box).  This company is a complete scam, they clearly did not read the claim and just automatically rejected it.  I will be disputing this purchase with my credit card.

The painting of their facade was blocking the entire sidewalk for hours at an extremely busy time of day on one of the busiest streets in philly for foot traffic.

"I purchased an emerald baguette stud earrings less than 2 months ago.  Ive worn it twice. I love it a lot except the other day, it totally fell off my right ear. It almost went down the drain as I was washing my hands. The 14k gold backing for some reason did not fit eventhough Ive had it on all day. Weird! I went back to this location to make a complaint. I was greeted by the manager, Emma. She quickly replaced my backing and gave me an extra one with no questions asked. Excellent customer service! This is the 2nd pair of mejuri earrings I own. The jury is still out on the quality but I do like the customer service Ive had in both, Philly and Calgary stores.

"Yesterday I went to buy my daughter a Christmas present, I wanted something simple and beautiful.

I was overjoyed how fast and simple it was to complete my transaction. And every question I asked Daze knew the answer.

"Whatever you do, dont buy from here. We have purchased 5 pieces of gold jewelry and 4 broke in under 2 years. Unfortunately we werent aware of their limited 2 year warranty, and they wont do anything for us since its been a couple months over 2 years. Gold chains and gold clasps should not break in half. Go elsewhere.UPDATE-Since this review, they reached out and after lots of back and forth, they replaced some of the items. Its truly unfortunate they didnt take care of us as paying customers.

I told and showed the store associate what I wanted in person and on my phone but she still managed to order the wrong item, creating more of a hassle and problem for me, in which I am still out of the amount I paid because I did not get the refund (for a wrong order I did not place nor want). It is not a small amount and the customer service is lacking for a place that sells overpriced and expensive jewelry. Please make sure to confirm with the customer that the order that is being placed is correct before charging the customer $200 !

"Im happy with the jewelry I purchased and the customer service I received from the sales associates, but am disappointed with the lack of professionalism from the piercer. She was 25 minutes late to my scheduled appointment and she also told me the incorrect price for some of the jewelry I wanted, so I ended up spending more than I had expected. I only realized this after checking the receipt in my email inbox, which arrived after I left the store, and when I called back to get clarification on pricing, all the piercer said was that she was sorry that she must have incorrectly memorized the pricing. For the amount I spent on jewelry and the hour I drove to get to my appointment on time (since theres only a 10-minute grace period), I expected more from Mejuri. Based on my experience, I will likely not be visiting again any time soon and would not recommend the piercing studio at this location.",Bethesda,0,2024-11-10 00:00:00,Mejuri,3,"7247 Woodmont Ave, Bethesda, MD",MD,Michelle Kim,
"Super nice & personable staff! But the quality of the Jewlery is really questionable…. Ive had issues with now 2 pairs of earrings from them & with the price point it wouldnt really make sense to pay almost $300 for a pair of earrings that just fall off your ear after 1-2 months of wearing them. Also gotta kick rocks if you do because warranty doesnt cover that! The make and quality is just, weird? White gold but I dont know…. Cheap white gold? Ive never had earrings just fall off my ear. The earring backings on most of their earrings are so cheap looking and cheaply made. For the earrings that clasp on, they just arent made the best so the clasp ends up not… clasping.. They suggest to buy plastic earring backings from Amazon to help keep them in. But Id hope if I buy a diamond gold earring the earring would kinda stay in my ear, ya know? 5/5  location, 5/5  customer service/staff, 2/5  Jewlery quality, just go for the rings Id stray away from earrings",Bethesda,0,2024-12-10 00:00:00,Mejuri,4,"7247 Woodmont Ave, Bethesda, MD",MD,Britteny Etienne,

"Mejuri is based in Toronto, Canada and has made itself known for its fine and semi fine jewelry. Mejuri offers a large range of accessories from Diamond rings to Amethyst bracelets, carefully crafted with sustainable materials.As someone who loves fine jewelry but understands the importance of budgeting I love how Mejuri is so budget friendly starting at just 35$. Mejuri is a step in the right direction for luxury jewelry that is both accessible and sustainable.Having worn multiple of Mejuris pieces, Ive found them to be quite modern yet elegant. This jewelry is luxurious, sustainable, and practical for everyday wear.Some pros of Mejuri are its affordable price, quality materials, and sustainability but it does have a few cons. Some pieces are less durable and dont last as long as some of the more expensive pieces and some people find it to have too little range of styles.Mejuris products are aimed towards people with more modern values of quality and ethical purchasing. Its for the people who want some luxury to their lives without having the quilt of being too extravagant.The shopping experience at Mejuri is straightforward with a user friendly website and clear descriptions of products. Alternatives to Mejuri that fit its ethical and quality standards are Catbird and Blue Nile.Overall I would give Mejuri 5 stars for its commitment to making quality and ethical luxury jewelry. Although it might not fit everyones style its a compelling option for those looking for cheap, sustainable, and quality luxury jewelry.",Bethesda,1,2024-06-10 00:00:00,Mejuri,5,"7247 Woodmont Ave, Bethesda, MD",MD,Hen Rockman,

"I had a terrible experience with Mejuri. The first pair of earrings I bought was defective—the clasp on one wouldnt open, and it got stuck in my ear. When I finally managed to get it off to send it back as a defective product, they had the audacity to claim the earrings werent in the box. Whether it fell out due to their mishandling or they didnt properly check, thats on them. Why would I keep defective earrings?Still, I decided to give them another chance and ordered a new pair. The same issue with the clasp happened again. This time, I checked the clasps immediately after opening, and they went right back in the box and were shipped back. Mejuri then claimed the earrings were in ""bad condition"" and refused to refund me—even though they never left the box for more than a few seconds.This company operates like a scam. Their return process and customer service are appalling. Save yourself the frustration and stay far, far away.",,3,2025-01-13 00:00:00,Mejuri,1,"1410 Peel St, Montreal, Quebec, Canada",,Victoria R,

When I heard they opened a store in Montreal I got excited thats why this time I decided to pick up my order and check out the store. And I just did today, I bought a mini hoop 14k yellow gold, it is actually my second mini hoop. But I noticed the mejuri tag is missing and I dont see the 14k unlike the old mini hoop I have. As you can see in the photo, the one on the right is the first one I bought few months ago there is a tag on the side while the one on the left has none. I was told by an agent I can have it exchange because there should be a Mejuri tag :(11/30/2024 Update:I went back to the store this morning and one of the staff said  the law dont allow them anymore to make the hallmark or tag to be easily visible. She pointed a super tiny marking inside. It is so small, so hard to see and read even with a magnifying glass.

They made me make an account and said the store credit will be transferred there, however I later found out that the store credit was never transferred there. I called the store explaining the situation and said that the store credit could only be given to the person who ordered the jewelry and could not be sent to me directly. So, I made an account for no reason and the employee who helped me in person had no clue what they were doing either. I had to bother my aunt for the store credit, I gave them her email, but after a day she never received an email containing the store credit. I called the following day and explained she never got it, and they sent the store credit to my email directly.

"My sister and I have been return customers to Mejuri since this summer. I bought my sister a necklace for her birthday gift from Meijuri. We visited the store in Montreal on Dec 26 at 2:30pm.  She wanted to exchange the  necklace for a bracelet. The necklace was a 50th bday gift for Nov 7 and this was the first opportunity to exchange since one of us lives in Toronto. The service we received was so horrendous that we left determined never to return.  The salesperson was rude, unhelpful and arrogant. As repeat customers, the exchange my sister wanted to make would have provided Meijuri with a higher profit but we were immediately referred to the «30 day limited exchange policy» with no opportunity to explain the situation.

"Problem number 1# 14K gold fades the gold sheen with in a month and half just from sweat and exposure to air. Jewellery is meant to be worn. They should consider protective coating for longevity and durability. which the Jewellery does not have.I bought the garnet and gold ring. The fading was a fate I had accepted for an $800 ring. I shouldnt have because $800 could get you 22k rings which would have resell value. But the choice is yours.Problem number 2# Damages easy. I got a second ring for $515 the croissant ring. Wore it once. When buying it I asked if I am able to return this if I dont like it tomorrow, the sales rep responded yes.I came back to find out this wasnt eligible for a return because theres a slight scratch (invisible to my eye but they apparently have equipment in the store). I was only give the option to exchange. I told her that it did not make sense she is taking back the ring anyway but not letting me take the money back. Pretty scamy since mejuri swears on sustainability and using recycled gold and silver upto 90+ %. Store manager with red hair mentions the store will not be able to sell it and LOSE money. And she was sorry the sales rep had a miscommunication and did not tell me the conditions of return especially when I asked if I will be eligible to return.This wont  reach you, but Sales reps. I know you need to upsell a product at a store and offer advise but when people give you their budget please be accomodatingand not confuse them with more expensive choices. At mejuri we spend a lot of money for a product that wont give us the joy for long. You guys are the last hope. I walked away today saying your miscommunication cost me $500. I know you work hard but so do I.Happy Holidays.",,7,2024-02-10 00:00:00,Mejuri,1,"1410 Peel St, Montreal, Quebec, Canada",,Anika Rahman,

"This was by far the worst experience I have ever had. I purchased a bracelet and less than 48 hours went to return it and the lady told me it didnt pass ""inspection"". This is completely ridiculous and she told me its because people will wear jewelry for one night and then return it. I told her this is an every day bracelet why the hell would I buy this for one night. Totally disappointing, would never return to mejuri and this was my first experience.",,2,2024-08-10 00:00:00,Mejuri,1,"1410 Peel St, Montreal, Quebec, Canada",,Deborah Athanasopoulos,

I opened to my excitement however the gold is all discolored and even the butterfly backing. Their customer service is horrible and keep asking for an order number obviously I dont have as it was a gift. They say they use high quality materials. OBVIOUSLY NOT,  I have  jewelry from Swarovski and Pandora and after 10 years no discoloration.

"Its not a great experience is it? When youre buying they always tell you all about the refund/exchange flexibility and warranties and wonderful perks wow what a respectable store youd think.And then lo and behold, they sell you a defective earring and you gift it to someone and they open it and try it on right in front of you and a group of people, only to realize the earring doesnt clip… What an embarrassing situation to be put in the first place, for something valued 650$+! Seriously…And of course when you go back right away to return it, they refuse! Suddenly theyre all about valuing quality and thoroughly checking their products. Where was this diligence when I was going home with the product? Where was the thoroughness and attention to detail then?Be very careful when youre shopping from this store. Do a quality check before purchasing anything - or better yet dont purchase anything they are incompetent thieves.",,15,2024-02-10 00:00:00,Mejuri,1,"1410 Peel St, Montreal, Quebec, Canada",,Ghalia K,

"Buyer beware :I received 2 sets of earrings as a present from Mejuri. I wanted to exchange them for another style. I went to the store and the store manager said that they have to do a quality check on the items. To my surprise, the earrings did not pass the check. I explained to the store manager that I simply tried the earrings for about 5 min before safely packing them away. I told them that maybe the items were sold to us that way however the store manager insisted that I brought back faulty items. It was definitely a horrible customer experience.Do not purchase from Mejuri unless you have tried the item in advance. Otherwise, buying online is a better option.",,10,2024-02-10 00:00:00,Mejuri,1,"1410 Peel St, Montreal, Quebec, Canada",,A,
"I received a beautiful diamond  Riviera bracelet as a gift a little less than a year ago.  I now find it a little tight and I contacted customer service recently. After a lot of back and forth I was told there is nothing they can do without the receipt.  I cannot get the receipt as it was a gift from a previous employer. ALL I WANTED was to purchase a couple of extra links for the bracelet, but they said it was not possible. They told me the best solution was to return the item for credit and repurchase a larger size, but they couldnt do that without the receipt.

"Buyer beware:I bought a necklace and pendant for my wife recently at that store. She really loved it but unfortunately it was too small so about 2 weeks later she went to the store to exchange it for something else. She was very excited to do so as she really liked Mejuris products.To her shock, the store refused to take back the necklace arguing that it was not up to their required standard for a return. My wife explained that the necklace was only worn for about 5 minutes to try it on before she decided it was too small. There were no visible issues to us, no scratches or anything of that nature. The staff simply said they did a test and the necklace had lost its shine. We tried to explain that whatever issues they think there is with the necklace, it was sold to me in that same condition. No success. It was as if we were trying to explain to them that we are not trying to scam them or something. It was a humiliating experience.I contacted customer service online, explained the situation and sent them pictures of necklace. They agreed that it was in perfect condition and sent me a return label. I had to then go through the hassle of shipping it back myself and wait a couple of weeks for reimbursement.Unless you are buying something for yourself and know for certain that you will not in any scenario want to return the item, buy at your own risk because there is no guarantee the store will accept their product back even if it is in perfect condition.",,14,2024-02-10 00:00:00,Mejuri,1,"1410 Peel St, Montreal, Quebec, Canada",,Karim Haddad,

"EDIT:Since writing this review, Mejuri has really made a big effort to right a wrong which is very much appreciated. They were having inventory issues and couldnt send me the backings. They sent me the piece I was missing as soon as possible and even sent me a gift for the unfortunate inconvenience I had went through.—————————————-I got a piercing during the opening weekend at the Montreal store back in January. I was told that I was going to get another follow-up appointment 2 months later to resize the flat back stud once the swelling went down.It seems they only had a piercer for the opening weekend because they no longer have a piercer to do the follow up appointment that was included with my purchase. I have called and I have visited the store and each time they say they are really close to hiring a piercer professional and that they cant give me the resized flat back stud because only a professional can handle it since it must be sanitized. I had left my contact information with them saying that they would reach out to me as soon as a piercer was available but, never heard back.I finally decided to contact the Custom Happiness Team and they said they would follow up with me and that I can always set up an appointment at their Toronto location. Another two weeks pass by and still no resolution. Unless the travel expenses would also be included in my follow-up appointment in Toronto, I am getting the sense that I am being placated time and time again without them actively trying to resolve their mistake.I find this highly irresponsible that Mejuri would offer a service for their opening weekend without making sure their clients would have the proper aftercare.",,2,2024-02-10 00:00:00,Mejuri,4,"1410 Peel St, Montreal, Quebec, Canada",,Marilina Cianci,

"Mejuri is a hit or miss - I love all my rings and bracelet, but beware of earrings. I have different sizes of hoops and they have the worst clasps. Bought, along with my mother the Pavé Medium Hoops for my birthday and after wearing them twice, lost one on my third wear!! When trying them on in store, I had asked the sales rep regarding the clasp, but she said it was fine, that sometimes you need to clip it harder. Half of $600+tx down the drain. Heartbroken.Edited:As a customer who had raised the issue with the sales representative, who assured me there was no issue with the earring, Mejuri still blames me for the loss of the earring. Train your employees better. Craft your jewelry better. Very disappointed with the service.Also avoid the piercing studio! I have 12 piercings, 2 from here and both have gotten infected. The piercer also didnt have the proper equipment, so had trouble aligning the needle with the piercing, which resulting in playing around to get it to fit until I couldnt take the pain anymore and we decided to repierce the hole.",,14,2024-02-10 00:00:00,Mejuri,2,"1410 Peel St, Montreal, Quebec, Canada",,Charlotte Keogh,

I bought from the online store which came from Canada. Never once on the website did it say anything about import charges and custom fees. I bought a $600 item and paid over €170 in import charges the day of delivery with no warning from the website at any point. This is something that should be disclosed before buying an item.

So we stayed in front of the door until an employee finally decided to come see us to explain that the store finally opened at 11:00.

"The customer service here is subpar. Its a busy location, so I wasnt expecting to be greeted by anyone. However, when I shared with a sales associate that a pair of my gold vermeil earrings from Mejuri had tarnished after only a couple of wears, she told me that thats what gold vermeil pieces do and I shouldve purchased solid gold jewelry. Her tone and attitude were condescending, and she didnt even try to pretend to help. Mejuri prides itself in the affordable gold vermeil pieces that do NOT tarnish easily, so I am puzzled as to why their sales associate did not stand behind the brand. Since then I only purchase solid gold jewelry, but from other brands.",North York,1,2024-12-10 00:00:00,Mejuri,1,"3401 Dufferin St, North York, ON, Canada",ON,Yiran Zhang,
"TERRIBLE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE. THEY DO NOT CARE ABOUT YOU OR YOUR BUSINESS.They attempted to host an exclusive event for M+ members on Nov 10,2024 at Yorkdale and failed the set capacity limits on the number of people who could rsvp to the event. We showed up at our designated time slot only to find hundreds of people lined up on a first come first serve basis.There was no order to the chaos.We were given mixed information but several different employees. One blonde girl only knew how to apologize she didnt really provide any help or answer questions. Another asian girl with blonde hair said someone would come through the line to take orders for people who knew what they wanted. And that did not happen. By the time someone else said there was a separate line to order outside the store that was after 1.5 hours of already waiting in the line. There were people making returns and ordering things online for pick up despite this being an after hours event. The mall closed at 7pm why are they taking regular transactions at the time of this special event. People were see skipping and hopping in and out of line.The girl (who said she was new she started in July) manning the line could not get through the entire line in over 2.5 hours because she kept on checking some peoples tickets then running back into then came out minutes later just to check a few more people and would continuously forget where she left off. If she just kept going through the line a lot of misinformation would not have been spread around and it would have made her available sooner to help people check out. She also did not actually check everyones ticket either some people around us didnt get checked. Once your ticket was verified there was no way to confirm that at the door, not that they were checking. So people hopped in and out of line after she checked that part of the line. Then after she was eventually done checking the line after 2hrs and 45 min, she didnt contribute to helping any other customers she just chatted with people in line. She also had the good sense to bring out 3 drinks for 3 people when there was still 2 dozen people who hadnt had any drinks. So not really sure why she was put in charge of manning the line she did an extremely poor job of it.They eventually started handing out drinks to the customers in line 2 hours into the wait and then the people at the end of the line had to wait 45 minutes to get their drinks because the person handing out drinks needed a break supposedly. I wasnt aware that handing out drinks required a specific skill set they were non alcoholic.The manager refused to come out to address any customers and said he had no power to do anything. There was no apology or consideration at all and definitely no customer service experience at all. So Im not sure what your purpose is if youre a manager of a store and cant fix any customer issues or make any helpful decisions.I had a 7pm time slot and i saw people who had later time slots than me at 730 and 8 get helped and get items before me.Do not be fooled by Mejuri and their shiny objects, they have no common sense, no customer service experience, no competence. Especially at Yorkdale as well which is supposed to represent a client focused luxury experience mall.The photo attached does not show the line that went towards mac cosmetics to banana republic and then back and down all the way to babaton. You can see there is just a mass amount of people standing around the front of the store as well with no line organization or employees to organize these people which also created a safety hazard since the store is really not that big either.The event was supposed to be from 7-9 and i selected a 7pm time slot and after waiting over 2.5 hours I walked away without going into the store and a lot of disappointment.As someone who has spent quite a bit of money at Mejuri and who advocates for small businesses especially local to Toronto I am very disappointed by entire experience and will not be a returning customer.",North York,1,2024-12-10 00:00:00,Mejuri,1,"3401 Dufferin St, North York, ON, Canada",ON,Tiffany Cheung,

Unfortunately, when I took the necklace out of my pocket I discovered that part of the chain got tangled. I tried my best to untangle the chain but was unsuccessful due to the tight nature of the tangle, so I decided to stop by the Mejuri store in Yorkdale to see if they could help me out.I can assure you that my experience at the Mejuri Yorkdale far exceeded my expectations. Upon entrance, I was kindly greeted and they wasted no time trying to untangle the chain. In the end, Paola was successful in untangling the chain and went above and beyond by providing me with a new gift-box, a polishing cloth and a small tote bag. She also provided me with great advise on how to take care of my necklace. Although the store got busy, Paola didnt seem to be in a rush to get to the next customer, but took her time to ensure that I was being cared for and even went above and beyond which demonstrated excellent customer service.I am beyond satisfied with my experience at the Mejuri Yorkdale store and would visit again.",North York,0,2024-09-10 00:00:00,Mejuri,5,"3401 Dufferin St, North York, ON, Canada",ON,Isaac Jordan Melis,

The quality was terrible.not worth the money.so I returned them in the same packaging they came in and requested my refund. Well today I received an email telling me that because I took a tiny label off them and because they were scratched I would not be getting a refund!!!! Are you kidding me? If these rings were scratched then I received them that way. I had them on for all of 5 minutes. They were so thin they looked like thread around my finger. As for the string with a tiny label on it, this company can simply put another on and all is good. I have spent many dollars at this store and have never had a problem, however this has done me in.

"1/5  Stars - Disappointing Experience with Mejuri Im writing this review as a cautionary tale for others. In July, I visited the Mejuri store in Yorkdale Mall, Toronto, to purchase a wedding ring set. I tried on several styles and ended up buying a wish bone ring set for around $600 after tax. The sales associate assured me that my ring size was 6, and I trusted that the rings I received were the correct size. However, when I opened the box on my wedding day, I was shocked to find that the rings were too big. To make matters worse, the customer service experience was appalling. I sent emails and received responses from at least 4-5 different people, including one who even got my name wrong! They eventually offered to let me return the rings for store credit, but we werent comfortable sending the rings back by mail and dealing with the uncertainty of the process. We took the rings to our local jeweler, who confirmed that the rings were actually a 7.5 - almost 2 sizes bigger than my correct size. Now were out of pocket for resizing the rings. But the final straw was when our jeweler called to inform us that during the cleaning process, ALL OF THE DIAMONDS fell out of the rings! Were talking about a supposedly high-quality piece of jewelry from a trendy brand, and it cant even hold its stones in place. Its unconscionable.

My excitement quickly turned into disappointment as the items I purchased failed to meet even the most basic expectations.The overall quality of the jewelry was shockingly low. We pay this amount of money and expect to have a good quality Jewelry, or at least normal quality that we can wear them couple of times, but no! I didnt even wear the ring ONCE!! and now I cannot return it because it passed the 30 days. Color changing exactly happened to my necklace as well after wearing it once and I naively thought it cannot happen to my other purchases since it is too disappointing for this brand and this price. The pieces seemed more like costume jewelry than the elegant accessories I had hoped for. I use my other jewelry bought from inexpensive brands every day and this didnt happen to them!Im so furious that I couldnt wear the ring even once!

I spent $1,800 on my first visit at Mejuri. One of the earrings I was sold was faulty - the clasp on the hoop earring kept coming undone while I was wearing it. As a result, one of the earrings fell down the drain. When I contacted customer service, they said there was nothing they could do about it since the earring was lost. This logic is flawed because had the earring not been lost DUE to it being faulty, then they would have replaced the earring?

"I drove from London to this store today so that I could try on a list of rings I had. I am an active Mejuri customer and was willing to spend a considerable amount of money here, as this was a gift for my 10 year wedding anniversary. The store itself is truly beautiful, and the first person who helped us out was very friendly (the second person was not). However, only two of the 6 rings I had come to try were available to try on in the store. For one of the rings, the employee couldnt even find it, nor had heard of it. I pulled it up on the website to show her and she basically just said that it must be discontinued 🤷‍♀️ Now, this wouldnt have been too much of an issue if I hadnt tried all week leading up to this visit (almost 3 hrs drive) to call the store to check if they had the rings I wanted to try on. No one ever answered, and I also left a voicemail requesting a callback. I had a completely wasted trip to this store all because no one would answer the phone. 6 hours round trip I will never get back. If you live nearby, sure, go visit this store because its pretty.

The first time was ok, the manager at the front concierge it seems like was very nice and sociable! The second time I came when it wasnt quite busy, as there was no line like there usually is. Everyone seems pretty done with their lives and didnt really pay me any mind. The associate I dealt with did the absolute bare minimum to look for a size for me and help me with my request. She made me feel a bit uncomfortable and I felt a bit pressured into buying the product. She even handed me the phone to do her job which is asking me basic details that were already in the system. I got what I wanted but since I know my size I would just go online from now on, with the retail front not being very helpful and a bit cold. For such a brand that is all about diversity and positivity, there was a great lack of it on the retail front. I hope they improve their overall customer service experience in the future! :)EDIT:The jewelry tarnishes so fast! I bought a pair of sterling silver earrings and didnt put them away ""properly"", which is just sitting in a drawer, and they tarnished so badly! What a waste of my money.

"Edit:Their team reached out over email and made great effort to invite me back and fix the situation. Changing to 3 stars.New to the Mejuri brand and I love a lot of the mens jewelry designs. But hoping corporate sees this review so the company can improve its customer service experience from online to in store:Whats the point of having your customers book an online styling appointment, fill in information on the specifics they need help with and the specific items they want to see, then to show up at your appointment and the staff in store have no information about anything you wrote down?It kinda kills the point of even having an online appointment system. When it comes to luxury goods like jewelry, the experience of purchasing the item is just as important as the item itself.I came in on time for my appointment expecting to see a few specific items (and wanted to buy them if they looked just as good IRL as online). Then I ended up waiting 20-30 minutes while the employee went back and forth to the back of the store telling me ""oh we cant find this, we cant find that. I can only bring you one item a time,"" then proceed to not talk to me at all while Im trying things on when she finally ends up finding the items (back room need better organization?). I ended up leaving before I even saw all the items I wanted cuz it was comical how bad the customer service experience was lol.Maybe the employees dont get commission so they dont care as much. Im not expecting a Chanel or Van Cleef level of customer service, but at least something on par with Apples organizational system where info is actually passed along would be great.",North York,3,2024-02-10 00:00:00,Mejuri,3,"3401 Dufferin St, North York, ON, Canada",ON,Rob Woe,
My boyfriend and I went to Yorkdale mall  to look for a gift for my birthday  it was yesterday June 18th.As we walk around we came across at the MEJURI store we saw a line up and wanted to check it out.My boyfriend liked these pair of Pavé Diamond Bold Huggie Hoops and he purchased them for me.I wore it at work today to show everyone I almost lost one because the clasp was defective.Furious  beyond words.I tried to call them today left several messages no one returned my calls.Got a hold of the live chat who tells me to ship the earrings back so I could get a new pair shipped to me.Terrible customer service and the company has not standard or customer service.I was better off going into Tiffany and be satisfied than upset.Wont visit this store ever again…..😝I wont recommend you will be very upset go elsewhere and invest your money in better quality.Should have checked the reviews no wonder why the rating is so low 👎.,North York,1,2024-02-10 00:00:00,Mejuri,1,"3401 Dufferin St, North York, ON, Canada",ON,Filu S,

The customer service was extremely poor.

I had to wait twenty minutes for her to tell me I shouldve read the email where it states that because it was a ""momentmaker"" item it couldnt be returned in store but because I was here shed do it for me.Except a special return policy isnt mentioned in any of the emails or on their site at all.  she had me show her because ""I wasnt looking in the right place"".

"I never write reviews because theyre a waste of time. But Ive never been this upset with retail before. Bought a bracelet as a gift for a friend and it broke after one day. Wanted a refund because it was clear the design of the bracelet was the cause. Mejuri Yorkdale would not accept a refund and said I have to exchange it for the same bracelet when I know it will break again. I had to fight to get it exchanged for a different design and they also made it final sale. Why would someone want the same item if it broke after one day. Also, the manager at the Yorkdale mall who claims she has a lot of experience in the jewelry industry even went as far as blaming my friend for wearing it to sleep (bracelet broke overnight and was found next morning in bed). Blaming their customer is one of the most unprofessional things you can do in retail. The bracelet shouldnt be this bad quality to break after one night anyway.

"Nice and cool store.- The lack of price next to the models is painful. For each of the prices, we have to ask the sellers and they spend some time looking for the price on their phones, and finally the selection and purchase process becomes difficult.- The names to find on the website are very similar and the sizes are listed on the website with different names. Thats why its hard to choose.- After shopping, when we had to wait for packaging, there wasnt a chair to sit or a sofa to rest on.These little things can improve the shopping experience.I hope they make the purchase process easier.",North York,1,2024-09-10 00:00:00,Mejuri,3,"3401 Dufferin St, North York, ON, Canada",ON,Amir Astaneh,

"1 star is generous for this business.During Black Friday, my husband purchased two pairs of earrings for me. The items arrived on December 5th, but the sapphire earrings were dull and poor in quality. I filed a return the same day, and the package was shipped back shortly after.A week later, I received an email stating my refund was only $76.28, despite paying $184.76. The return receipt (1st photo) showed the discount was incorrectly applied twice. When I contacted Mejuri, they claimed one pair was ""scratched"" and unsellable, attaching a photo as evidence (2nd photo). However, their original return email made no mention of any scratch issue. Luckily, I had taken photos before returning the items, which clearly show no scratches.This is unacceptable and unethical behavior from a business.

I have deleted my review for Alannah as she is no longer working at Mejuri. The customer service at this location is atrocious! They are openly rude to their customers and I just discovered that my wishbone ring has lost a diamond. Horrible craftsmanship for the price I Sadly paid for this thin little ring. My Advice - go to any other jewellery store but this one. The prices are outrageous and not worth it. The prices have all gone up a lot and nothing is worth the price increases.

"It was my first time visiting a Mejuri store. On August 23rd, 2024, I purchased a stud as a gift for a friend and booked a piercing appointment for August 25th. However, when my friend and I arrived on Sunday, we were informed that my appointment was not in the piercers calendar. Thankfully, I had taken a screenshot of the booking confirmation, which eventually allowed us to secure the 4:40 pm slot.Unfortunately, this situation led to a heated conversation with the piercer, Ella, who was quite rude to both my friend and me. During our conversation, I had to address her passive aggressiveness. Even when I spoke with the store manager, Ella continued to continuously interrupt us, adding to the frustration. This entire experience left a very bitter taste, and I ultimately decided not to go through with the piercing.Given how things transpired, I am considering returning the piece of jewelry I purchased and am hesitant to visit the Ossington store again.I hope this feedback helps improve future customer experiences and ensures that situations like this do not happen.",Toronto,2,2024-09-10 00:00:00,Mejuri,1,"64 Ossington Ave, Toronto, ON, Canada",ON,Alisha Singh,

"I had two frustrating visits to Mejuri this week that left me highly disappointed. On my first visit, I witnessed an elderly woman struggling to enter the store with a walker while three sales associates stood nearby chatting without offering any assistance. As for my own experience, I called ahead to check if a bracelet was in stock and was told it would be held for me (was told the hold was approved by a manager and the sales associate took down my information). However, when I came in later that day, I was informed that the bracelet had been sold despite the prior agreement, and no effort was made to help me resolve the issue.A few days later, I called again to inquire about another item. After some back and forth, I was told they might have it in stock. When I asked to confirm the sales associate told me I can look if you want but it will take a while - If I am coming into the store I want to make sure the item is in stock. I was told they couldnt hold it for me, despite a prior associate having told me they can hold an item for me just days earlier. I also inquired about engraving a ring (was told the machine was down that day but would be running the following day).  When I arrived in store I was told machine was still broken—something I was never informed of by other stores, which had sent me to the Ossington location in the first place. The engraver has been down for months according to a sales associate.  The solution provided was that I keep checking back in the new year and hopefully it would be running.  This item was supposed to be a gift and now I will have to source and pay for the engraving.The communication between staff members was horrendous, and the lack of customer service was shocking.

"Purchased a rope chain and only wore it a few times until the clasp broke. Mejuri would not honor the warranty even though it was within the warranty period. This is certainly not fine jewelry it is simply cheap jewelry. You are better off purchasing cheap gold chains that are easily replaceable, or better to spend more for a higher quality brand. Wont buy anything from Mejuri again.Their response below tells you all you need to know. If your item breaks they will blame you for accidental damage or normal wear and tear (after wearing a few times to office). In contrast, I have a similar chain from another mid-level brand that is 20 years old. I wore it daily for years even to sleep, shower, sports, I still have that chain and the clasp is fine.

"Poor quality jewellery! I went into this store asking if there was something they could do about the clasp that came off a necklace I purchased from Mejuri, I understand the product was out of warranty but youd think for the price point the jewellery should last more than a couple of years. What was particularly disappointing was going in and being told ""your best bet would be to go to a jeweller to get this fixed"" confused, I looked around and asked ""isnt this a jeweller?"" The woman at the front counter shrugged it off and went back to what she was doing. If youre looking for good quality jewellery for a decent price point I recommend the nearby store Armed on Dundas. They have reasonable prices, their pieces last more than 2 years, and if something breaks theyll actually fix it for you as a good quality jeweller should.",Toronto,1,2024-07-10 00:00:00,Mejuri,1,"64 Ossington Ave, Toronto, ON, Canada",ON,Cindy S,

Excellent experience at Mejuri on Ossington! We were greeted by Linda who was super friendly and VERY patient. I had no idea what kind of jewelry to buy or what suits me. She was so patient as she suggested great pieces to compliment my necklace. I tried on many and was very impressed. We came into the store with our little baby and Linda was so sweet to her too and just overall an amazing person. I will recommend this store to all my friends and family and especially will recommend working with Linda who was very informative and had great sense of style.,Toronto,1,2024-02-10 00:00:00,Mejuri,5,"64 Ossington Ave, Toronto, ON, Canada",ON,Katherine Lis,

"I would recommend to go find other places if you want to get ear piercing. Some professional piercing studio with reliable service quality. I should have done my research and read the review before getting my piercing done here.I had good experience back then when this store was located on Dundas st. and when they used to bring a local piercing parlour to their store and throw so called a piercing party. So I decided to try their piercing studio this time.On a day before my piercing appointment, I checked their website for available piercing jewelry. I didnt want anything too fancy, so I went for my appointment with $98 ones in my mind. On the day, basically I had only 5 choices, 2 of the options were $128 each, others like $300+. Ok, $30 x2 over the budget was find enough, so whatever.When the time for my check up appointment approached, it got cancelled, rescheduled, and cancelled again. This time, they apparently dont have a piercer available.Will I go back for a new piercing? NEVER. Would I recommend to others? NEVER. Will I go back maybe for their jewelry?

"I bought a ring for my girlfriend on Black Friday but it was the wrong size. When we came in a few days later to exchange it the sale had ended which would mean that I couldnt just pay the difference on the sale price, I would have to pay  (~$500) more. But after the associate spoke to her manager they honored the Black Friday price on the exchange, so I just paid $90 for the larger size ring. Very little push back, made me happy and we will come back to buy more jewelry from them in the future.Thanks again!",Toronto,0,2024-02-10 00:00:00,Mejuri,5,"64 Ossington Ave, Toronto, ON, Canada",ON,A A (Eckwitte),

"I will never shop at Mejuri again after dealing with the manager at this location.For Christmas, my mother got me a ring from this location but sadly it was slightly too small. When I went to exchange this ring, I brought all the receipt cards that my mom had been given, but they told me I couldnt exchange the ring.  The ring my mother bought was not associated with those order numbers.There was no record online as well that my mom bought this ring or that it was associated with her credit card.Long story short, after spending 2+ hours over the phone and in store trying to resolve this issue, we discovered that at the time my mom was checked out, she was checked out incorrectly for the wrong ring. We did not have the croissant ring (that ring has been discontinued), but was charged 98$ for it, and the ring we bought was the charlotte bold ring (128$).We were accused of stealing the ring multiple times even though their sales rep made a big mistake and admitted that that must have happened. Upon exchanging the ring we had the full packaging (bag and box and exchange/return tag) and all the receipt cards yet we were still accused by the sales rep and the manager.We were nice enough people to just pay the difference in price for the ring instead of arguing. But after being so disrespected by management at this location and the sales rep it is not worth giving your business.",Toronto,5,2024-04-10 00:00:00,Mejuri,1,"64 Ossington Ave, Toronto, ON, Canada",ON,Iva Skoko,

They only had a small handful of other options available and all of them were over my budget. It was a huge waste of time both waiting for an appointment and then to be told that they didnt have the selection I wanted (when it is available on their website).

"Ive had some quality gripes with Mejuri lately- everything from my gold vermeil ring tarnishing while it was still relatively new, to my 14k diamond initial pendant literally snapping in half within 9 months of purchase. Unfortunately, they were not able to honour their product warranty, as they determined that what happened with my pendant was not a quality issue on their end. But I would have to contest that that was definitely not the case. Im sure its easy for companies to just blame things like this on wear and tear to refuse warranty, but for an expensive, 14K solid gold with diamonds piece, I REALLY expected better from Mejuri.Mejuri used to pride itself on being affordable, but youre better off searching for 14K solid gold pieces on Etsy from independent, reputable jewellers. A lot of their pieces are universal designs (i.e. croissant ring, beaded ring, paperclip necklace) so you just have to know how to search properly.

"I had never ordered on-line  nor entered a Mejuri store prior to last week. I saw a beautiful pair of pearl earrings on-line which I thought would be perfect for my daughter so I went into the new store on Ossington in Toronto.The stylists Monique and Matt assisted me and both were very knowledgeable on the product and so sweet and easy-going. I did not feel rushed in the slightest. They helped me select some stacking rings for myself and those earrings I had in mind for my daughter.The store is very well laid out and gorgeous.I took one ring home, one ring was delivered to my home in 2 days and I had them ship my daughters earrings to her home which took only 3 days.I am very happy with my in-store purchases and the service there as well and now that I have seen the merchandise, I will not hesitate to order on-line",Toronto,1,2024-02-10 00:00:00,Mejuri,5,"64 Ossington Ave, Toronto, ON, Canada",ON,Anna Sobrino,

"My wifes boyfriend suggested I get her some Croissant Dôme Hoops for our 2-year anniversary. I hate the fact that hes the one recommending stuff she likes — after all Im the one who married her. But, I have to say his suggestion came in clutch; especially after my predicament at the Mejuri Vancouver store last Summer.This Chicago location is properly my favourite Mejuri store Ive seen so far. The venue is very spacious, and the staff was super friendly. Between me and you, the Chicago staff was chill AF compared to Vancouver. Overall, I ended up spending more than I expected on the gift because I love their stuff so much. Sadly, that cut into my date-night budget at Nobu, but my wife loved the gift.",Chicago,19,2023-02-10 00:00:00,Mejuri,5,"940 W Randolph St, Chicago, IL, United States",IL,Marco Marone,
Do not waste your money coming here. Gorjana stands by their pieces and when you are spending 100 dollars on jewlery pieces you expect them to last more than a few months. Ridiculous. Every ring I have bought here has tarnished and been terrible quality. They then blame you for how you have treated the jewelry. Save yourself the $ and buy from amazon if you want jewelry that lasts 90 days tops,Chicago,0,2025-01-27 00:00:00,Mejuri,1,"940 W Randolph St, Chicago, IL, United States",IL,Elizabeth Powers,
"I dont even know where to begin. A year ago I bought 2 pairs of gold and diamond earrings that totaled to over $1K. Within days the clasp on one loosened. Within 3 months they started to tarnish. Went in store to show them and received store credit so I bought 2 other pairs. Within 4 days the clasp bent on one of them and I almost lost it. I reached out at this point requesting a full refund although their policy only does store credit. I explained that if I have to respect their policy I expect them to respect my expectations that when I spend so much on earrings I want them to last. I went back and forth for months with different reps. You can only text or email, no phone calls and I dont live in Chicago, I am out of state. They initially denied the warranty completely. I continued to explain how the clasp on this expensive earring broke quicker than any of my cheap Amazon jewelry. Then they agreed to fully refund me once I sent the products back, which I did. Once they received my earrings they sent another email saying they changed their mind on the refund and I can only get store credit because the product was returned bent??? Yes exactly thats why I dont want it anymore, because your jewelry is so cheaply made it cant even last a week. I literally do not want anything to do with them anymore and do not want any of their crappy,  poor quality and overpriced jewelry.

"Extremely disappointed with the service at Mejuri. I was planning to purchase a diamond bracelet for holiday while having my necklace polished. When I got back the necklace it was tangling and unwearable. I asked one staff for help while shopping for the bracelet. The staff with a hair bang was rude and impatient. She quickly lost patience and hastily tried to dismiss me, claiming she was too busy to help with others(if you are someone who is a pro in the jewelry store couldnt fix it how come I can fix it???). When I asked to see the manager saying that I cant leave the store with a necklace like this, suddenly they quickly fix it with some magic. Overall BAD in-store service. Definitely need more training on some staff.

"I recently had an unfortunate experience at this location. Last week, a friend and I visited to purchase some pieces we had been eyeing and participate in their early access sale, which was invite only. We visited this store as soon they opened because my friend was traveling later in the day, and wanted to take advantage of the sale before she left. Since there were no signs up about the early accesssale, we asked staff about it.Several staff (honestly, too many staff) repeatedly asked if we actually received the invitation. Despite the fact that we knew more about the sale than your own customer service, they repeatedly asked--seeming to question whether someone like my friend would have actually received it. It was extremely odd. Now this would have been fine, but for the fact that after asking again and again, they then said they couldnt help because the sale wasnt until 7pm and there was no way to provide us with access to the sale ahead of that time.If that was truly the case, I dont know why we would be asked again and again whether we actually received the email. My friend and I were also told that the store was understaffed and they would have difficulty assisting us at all.This was my first time in this store. And it left a terrible taste and impression on me, and the culture and values of Mejuri.

"Hubby and I got new rings for each other as Anniversary gifts a couple of years ago. He picked a really nice black one, I think it was called the Kent. It came professionally wrapped and even included a great silicone one to wear if needed from time to time. It also has a warranty and I thought that was great. However, back in May of this year our Kia was taken by the self proclaimed ""Kia boys"" and his ring was in the arm rest (gym, weights etc). After filing a police report, we contacted Mejuri and explained the situation. We were politely told that although they were sorry for the circumstance, a lost ring isnt covered under the warranty. It only covers damages to rings that are still in possession. Mejuri also offered for us to look at some other rings they have in stock and quoted the discounts available at that time. Although we left that conversation ring less, CPD recovered our car by that evening AND the ring was still there. Overall, great product, great quality…just be careful to ask whats all covered in events such as theft of merchandise etc regarding warranties.",Chicago,2,2024-02-10 00:00:00,Mejuri,4,"940 W Randolph St, Chicago, IL, United States",IL,PennyFrierson Enterprises,
"Worth the time and money.  I went into the West Loop location this past Saturday for the first time, and I am very happy with my experience with Jackie.  I made an appointment to get my ears pierced ahead of time and had a general idea of what jewelry I wanted to be pierced with.  They have a section in the back, by the piercing studio for you to select the allotted studs they use to pierce.  I am glad I arrived 20 min early.  It gave me enough time to double check if the jewelry online were the same and it was.  They dont have an option to tip, so I would recommend bringing cash.  ( I dont tip ppl for everything, however this qualifies it) I was lucky Jackie had a client that came early, because I had some concerns with a 40 yr old piercing my parents had done for me at 2 months old.  The old one was so high on my lobe and close to my head, and she took great time, patience and care to show me why she chose the location and exact position.  Needless to say, but I will, corp. needs to allot 45 min as standard amount of time.        This IS a lux experience, and the short window given to the piercer and client, puts a lot of stress on both parties involved.  Mejuri needs to know how lucky they are to have Jackie, and her professionalism that saved the day for the limited time we had.  As for the rest of the staff, everyone had a caring smile, even the lovely security guard.",Chicago,0,2024-02-10 00:00:00,Mejuri,5,"940 W Randolph St, Chicago, IL, United States",IL,Tiffany Keorkunian,

Then we bought bands in those sizes to be shipped directly to us—not ideal, but we hoped the sizes wed pegged in-store were correct. They reassured us that, if either of us needed to move to a different size, the exchange process would be a breeze.It was not. While one of our initial rings was a success, the other needed a new size. Returning to the store to exchange it kicked off a months-long comedy of errors. The clerks for this visit had trouble at every step—finding our order, processing an exchange, checking stock. After a very long wait, it was confirmed the store still did not have stock of basic gold bands in average sizes, so we would have to essentially place an online order again. To prevent having to return to the store again, they recommended we order the next two half sizes so both could be tried on, one kept and one returned. From there the clerks had immense trouble processing an exchange, at one point turning the iPad around to show it wasnt going through the way they were trying—was that supposed to prompt an, I see, Ill just keep an expensive ring that doesnt fit then? Finally, they seemed to have been able to process the exchange and set up the two rings to ship to us.Except:we received no email confirmation of the exchange or shipment. We had to call Mejuri corporate, who were able to track down our order. Apparently the clerks had associated this new part of the order with a completely new customer account. While Mejuri corporate was able to find this, as a result for every subsequent step of the process—tracking the two new rings, returning the one that did not fit, receiving a refund for that ring—required going through Mejuri customer service.As I noted, we are happy with our rings. And Mejuris customer service on the web/phone are very helpful and prompt. Thus my experience at this store would lead me to recommend that customers simply do all shopping at Mejuri.com rather than in a store, and/or that Mejuri do a better job setting up its physical stores by having adequate stock and preparing their clerks for more situations than the simplest of sales.",Skokie,0,2025-01-10 00:00:00,Mejuri,2,"4999 Old Orchard Shopping Ctr Suite B34, Skokie, IL, United States",IL,Andrew Rogers,
"I greatly enjoyed my visit to Mejuri today. The two ladies working were fantastic! They were so kind, helpful, and patient as I picked out two rings that I am very excited about.

"Was on my 40th birthday trip and randomly walked in and asked if they pierced with a gun or a needle and was pleasantly surprised they had a piercer on sight with her own room.

"I got my ring Christmas before last, and only got to wear it twice before it started to tarnish (or what I thought was tarnish) terribly. I took it out today to clean it, and it doesnt really clean the spots- using a jewelry cleaning cloth- the gold started to chip off on the bottom and in the spots near the gem! And speaking of the gem, it also cracked on the corner on my second wear (last picture)! I was so hopeful for the opportunity to wear this gorgeous ring but its falling apart after only two wears. Its way too late for a refund, but Im just bummed about it. It just sits in its box it came in.",Nashville,0,2024-11-10 00:00:00,Mejuri,1,"2803 12th Ave S, Nashville, TN",TN,Brandee Lee Elston,

"Interesting concept for a jewelry store. Unfortunately, it activated one of my pet peeves, which is not having prices on items when you go into a store. In lieu of that, there are iPads situated throughout, that you are supposed to use to look up the item to find the price. Wouldnt call this a high-end jewelry store, but had a range of low and mid price items. Very cute and modern and streamlined. If youre a minimalist, you would love this place. I am somewhat of a maximalist, but I still liked it and think it would be a good place to pick up a gift :-) worth a visit.",Houston,1,2024-02-10 00:00:00,Mejuri,4,"888 Westheimer Rd Suite 158, Houston, TX",TX,Golden Eye,

"Absolutely horrible customer treatment, there is such poor quality of communication as well as lack of respect for the customer in order for them to truly justify their desired wishes to the employees. The environment is very assuming and totally makes the customer uncomfortable by being seen with much prejudice. Employees can be much more open towards helping and being kind to the customers than being very careless of how they might feel when being asked a serious question. Lacking quite poorly to provide ultimate assistance and help with any questions or concerns the customer may have just like I did. I was truly most profoundly disappointed and dissatisfied with the customer service towards me when I truly adored the online store itself.

"**Review for Miranda (piercer)**I recently had an incredible experience getting pierced by Miranda, and I cant recommend her highly enough! From the moment I walked in, her attentiveness and friendliness put me at ease. She took the time to answer all my questions and made sure I felt comfortable throughout the entire process.Her professionalism truly stood out; she was knowledgeable about the techniques and aftercare, ensuring I knew exactly what to expect. I was pleasantly surprised by how quick and relaxing the experience was. The pain was almost non-existent! Her gentle touch and calming demeanor made all the difference.If youre considering getting a piercing, I highly recommend visiting Miranda. Youll be in great hands, and youll leave feeling confident and satisfied with your new piercing!",Austin,0,2024-11-10 00:00:00,Mejuri,5,"11700 Domain Blvd Suite 126, Austin, TX",TX,Alé Sandoval,
"Buyer beware! This is a nice storefront with good branding, but dont let that fool you. Their products arent great quality, they do not adhere to their posted policies, and they have abysmal customer experience. I bought merchandise from them in late November, and exchanged for different styles a week later. During that exchange, my transaction was rung as store credit + purchase rather than refund + purchase, without informing me that this nullified my ability to receive a refund, were I to return these items. A week later, I returned these items and was refused my money back, even though all items were unworn, with tags, and had been purchased 7 days prior. They acknowledged their mistake and my compliance with their policy. But they feigned helplessness, stating that the system couldnt support them refunding my full purchase amount. Even with 2 weeks of escalations to their leadership team, they still refuse to do the right thing.It is so disappointing to have a business not act in the best interests of its customers and to be so dishonest and unethical in their transactions. Ive filed a complaint with the better business bureau and advise anyone dealing with them to exercise extreme caution. Do not trust them to adhere to their posted policies.",Austin,0,2025-01-10 00:00:00,Mejuri,1,"11700 Domain Blvd Suite 126, Austin, TX",TX,Stephanie Wilson-Wagner,
"LOVE Mejuri ATX! I have to give a VERY special shout-out to Miranda! She is the professional piercer at this location and provided the best experience with my new ear piercing. She made me feel super comfortable, explaining the entire process and addressing my questions, and took extra care while I picked out my piercing jewelry (which is gorgeous)! She also sanitized her studio space super well and gave me specific instructions on how to care for my new piercing.  HIGHLY recommend getting your ears pierced with Miranda!

"Ive been a loyal Mejuri customer for years and have always enjoyed everything Ive purchased. About a year ago, I bought a sterling silver bracelet that I loved. Unfortunately, the clasp broke shortly after, so I went to the store to exchange it under warranty. I also needed to exchange a ring I had purchased because it wasnt the right metal for me.While the store associate and manager were very helpful, they had a hard time processing both returns in the same transaction, which ended up taking nearly an hour. When the associate brought out the replacement bracelet, it was a different metal than the one I originally bought. She explained that the bracelet had been updated due to issues with the clasp and that this new version was more expensive, but I was getting it at the original price. When I expressed my preference for a refund, the manager informed me that it wasnt an option, which left me feeling a bit trapped. In the end, I accepted the outcome.Despite this, I continued ordering online and had a great experience with all my other purchases. On my birthday yesterday, I visited the store and, to my surprise, saw the bracelet I originally ordered right on the counter. I explained my situation to Megan, who was helping with purchasing a new chain necklace. She noticed an exchange on my account and suggested that I bring in the bracelet so they could help me get the one I initially wanted and paid for.Before heading back to the store, I decided to call and speak with the store manager, John. He briefly explained that their system sometimes loses order information and that without the original order, they couldnt assist me. Unfortunately, they also couldnt find the warranty exchange that the previous manager had processed a year ago.Im very disappointed after being a loyal customer for so long, and will be taking my business elsewhere. I recommend you do the same.",Austin,3,2024-09-10 00:00:00,Mejuri,1,"11700 Domain Blvd Suite 126, Austin, TX",TX,kyle church,

She refused to do the cleaning for the earring, even after I spent the time scrubbing it, despite what she had said before.

She is incredibly knowledgeable, professional, kind, and fast. Ive been pierced before by other piercers, but never  have I been treated to such a lovely experience. Miranda was very personable, helping to put me at ease. She then asked what I wanted and giving a knowledgeable opinion on how we could achieve it.I got an upper lobe and a helix done. She was so fast! It took more time for her to set up her sterile station and me picking out jewelry than the actual start and finish of the piercings, and that didnt take long. You can tell she is very experienced by how confident in her movements she is. Miranda then ensured I loved them before going into great detail on how to care for them until they heal. All I can say to that is she just won a lifetime customer.

"I love Mejuris timeless jewelry and had been a fan of their online store long before I knew they had a location in the Domain. As with any store in the Domain, parking can be a pain if you just need to run in for something during a busy time, but the store itself is a breath of fresh air. Its so fun to see the pieces all together in person. The store is very calming and the check out process is seamless.  I also really enjoy that their stylists walk you through whats in your bag after you check out. Like explaining that theres a travel bag and cleaning cloth under the foam, or telling you what the little black strip is for. Its little but it just shows that they care and gives you an idea of how to take care of your jewelry instead of just assuming that youd know. I love the Mejuri has a range, from vermeil to solid pieces, at a really fair price. The pieces that I enjoy from them are timeless but modern. Ive bought a lot of gold from them over the years but just picked up my first Mejuri pearls (Bold Pearl Drop Earrings) and couldnt be happier with the earrings, the store, and the service I received while there.",Austin,0,2024-02-10 00:00:00,Mejuri,5,"11700 Domain Blvd Suite 126, Austin, TX",TX,Amanda Schaefer,

Ive never worn them or anything because I ended up finding a better pair from a different jeweler at the Domain. They accused of me scratching the earrings and only allowed me to return the pearl charms. I dont see how that was possible if they werent worn.

She was very careful to avoid the cartilage and work with what she had, and they came out great! She was able to squeeze a third one in, and theyre done very evenly despite my cartilage level being different on each side.

"A very interesting experience here last week, and hasnt been a positive representation of the company.Last week was getting coffee at Starbucks when two of the employees here were having a conversation. The taller blond, Got very loud at the Starbucks and was asked to go outside with the other lady with dark brown hair.I didnt think much until I came to look at some new pieces as Im an avid fan of Mejuri. The blond lady was present in store, but was not welcoming and had a smerk on her face. Possibly because she recognized me from Starbucks as she was asked to leave. I later found out that she was visiting from California and her name was Britney from my advisor.If Mejuri allows their upper management to talk to store staff this way, I will no long shop or recommend Mejuri. Unhappy people deserve jobs where they are not face to face with employees. Maybe she isnt face to face often, but a simple smile would change my experience in store.

Since it was lost, they do not consider it a warranty issue and will not replace the one earring. She wore them twice. Your better off throwing 50 bucks out the window then buying their earrings. Now after the fact, Ive read numerous reviewers saying the same exact thing. Mejuri refuses to accept responsibility for faulty clasps. Also, I ordered 2 items for Christmas presents and they put them both in the same box.

Poor customer service. Take your business to an individual and support them rather than a company who doesnt respect the customers or keep track of orders properly. What a disaster this place is.,Austin,0,2024-09-10 00:00:00,Mejuri,1,"11700 Domain Blvd Suite 126, Austin, TX",TX,Joseph Moore,

Its been 10 days and I havent received my refund when I messaged to follow up. I was told my return actually wasnt processed due to ""human error"". Twice in one order… sounds like theyre not hiring the right humans. Not to mention they sent me an email confirmation stating the refund had been issued. Had I not checked I would have never known.

"Tried to go in to shop since there is no phone number to call. They require masks but do not offer any. They suggested I walk to Nordstrom and buy one, which I physically cannot do as Im disabled. They like would not give me a mask to wear. No options to purchase over the phone or curbside pickup or wait outside since I have no mask. No business card offered when I asked.

Really excellent customer service. I had a super nice stylist today and her manager also helped with my account. The stylist picked out several pieces for me and showed me how they looked stacked. She also gave helpful tips on what to consider when stacking jewelry (eg consider the length of your jewelry at home; change the texture of the chain if the lengths are the same). I wish I could remember their names it was just earlier today! The stylist was a young Asian woman. In general everyone was very nice and the vibes at the shop were good. Would recommend. I bought a silver sapphire piece and it looks very cute; they told me to keep it shiny just use a polishing cloth and keep it in the bag.,Los Angeles,0,2024-09-10 00:00:00,Mejuri,5,"8404 Melrose Ave, Los Angeles, CA",CA,X X,

"On May 14, I got piercing in Melrose location.The next day hell started. My ear doubled in size and was swollen, behind the ear was bruising and lymph nodes are inflamed! it was so painful that I could neither touch nor sleep from the pain. I thought its fine, its healing process, so 4 days on painkillers.But I couldnt stand  this pain anymore and returned to the store, took off the earring, the master said that she doesnt know whats going on. My ear was festering and that same day I went to the emergency room. There I was told that there was a terrible infection and I have to get really painful, emergency antibiotic shot I was also prescribed a course of antibiotics and I missed work because of all this.Terrible experience, 10 days of pain, antibiotics and doctors. And its still not done. Still trying to figure out with lymph nodes and pain leftovers.*UPD*I contact Mejuri as they asked me under this review just to be told that all possible infections, Hepatitis and I guess HIV I could get during the procedure its only my problem and basically they dont care.So be careful, if something going wrong with your piercing, only you gonna face it as well as you medical bills!",Los Angeles,0,2024-06-10 00:00:00,Mejuri,1,"8404 Melrose Ave, Los Angeles, CA",CA,Irina V,

"I got my second hole re-pierced at this locations pop-up piercing shop and it was not a transparent experience whatsoever. I have waited over year for another pop-up so I can get my post changed out to a shorter one - as promised by Mejuri - yet still not delivered. While they seem like a quality store, their jewelry needs to be cleaned constantly to be nice and isnt worth the investment in my opinion because most are not real gold/silver - just plated. For pricing of their plated jewelry, you can easily get better truly non-tarnishing jewelry from other brands for a lot cheaper.

"I went to Mejuri for the first time after being a longtime fan, but I was sadly disappointed with my experience. Beyond the security guard, no other employee of the store greeted me. I cruised around the store for maybe a solid 25 minutes before someone even offered me assistance or to inform me of the try-on procedures in the store. Despite my interest in purchasing the diamond cluster ring, no one actually bothered to assist me despite me verbally expressing my desire to purchase the ring. Everyone continued to ignore me and to help other guests. It wasnt until about 5 minutes prior to my exit that one associate offered me assistance.It left a bit of a bad taste in my mouth for the brand. While my experience does not reflect the brand as a whole, it did tarnish my perception of it. Additionally, I hadnt shopped at Mejuri since before the pandemic. So, it was exciting to see the pieces I was interested in in-person for the first time. But upon my visit, I came to find that much of Mejuris designs have changed. The rings appear even thinner and more fragile and delicate than when I first started shopping from the band. Dimond, pearl, and gemstone accents are miniscule on the rings. They are significantly smaller than when I first started buying from the brand.I understand they may have altered the designs to keep the prices affordable during a time where gold is at an all-time high, but they seem to have compromised quality for price. However, Im not so sure how affordable Mejuri is to the average consumer anymore. Along with my interest in the ring, I was also interested in some diamond hoop earrings from the brand and while I was browsing online at other vendors, I found nearly the same hoop earrings available at almost half the price at Zales.Overall, it seems times have changed for Mejuri and Im not sure if I will continue to shop there. For others, I would recommend exploring other options before purchasing at Mejuri. You get what you pay for, but sometimes its better to make an investment in a longer lasting product.",Los Angeles,4,2023-02-10 00:00:00,Mejuri,1,"8404 Melrose Ave, Los Angeles, CA",CA,Nadia Elizondo,
Horrible in store experience! I have ordered Mejuris jewelry online and was so psyched to see that they have a brick and mortar shop in LA. But the two people working were so rude and arrogant! The security guard was nice but the two attendants were terrible!

"Cute boutique with a friendly and helpful staff! Not your typical high-pressure-sales jewelry store experience, which I really appreciate. My only disappointment was that the pieces I went specifically to see (and buy) were out of stock at the Melrose location. When I asked about inventory, I got the feeling that the boutique doesnt carry much in-store (or perhaps I was just unlucky in my choices). Otherwise, an enjoyable shopping experience--it was great to see all of Mejuris stunning pieces in person and to try them on.

"Mejuri is one of my favorite places to go. Its the perfect place to buy a ""quick"" gift for friends or a one stop shop to buy yourself a little pick me up gift because you know youre purchasing quality.

"Im a huge fan of Mejuri and love that I can come here before making my final purchase decision. Though the website is great, you dont really know what the jewelry is going to look like on you until you try it on. Yknow what I mean?Everyone here is lovely, personable, kind, and helpful. They check in to make sure all your questions and needs are met, but they also dont hover and pressure you to buy something. Once you are ready to order, they will bring out an iPad and help you purchase it right then and there. Other than the showroom jewelry, they dont have jewelry in stock -- which means your order will arrive via mail. Just a heads up, in case you were hoping to get jewelry on the same day lol.Depending on how many people are already inside the store, you might have to wait a few min outside. It was a short wait for me, 10min at most.Parking can be tricky, as Melrose is always busy. I like to drive around and find parking in the residential area.",Los Angeles,0,2021-02-10 00:00:00,Mejuri,5,"8404 Melrose Ave, Los Angeles, CA",CA,Alice Kim,
"Lizell was the sales associate that helped me during my first time visiting the store. I came at a very good time during the  middle of the week, as I did not feel rushed to try on the products. Given that it was during covid, I had to wait in line outside while 2 customers were allowed in store. I liked that the staff did not pressure me into buying anything, but instead assisted in me trying everything that caught my eye. I appreciated that, as I do not like to be persuaded in buying anything. Lizell was super helpful and nice during my visit.

"I waited 50 minutes in the cold weather in line today to pick up a pair of $400 earrings I already paid full price for. The store was extremely understaffed with only two women working the day the store opened after being closed for multiple days for Christmas. In response to another customers complaint posted on this thread about the wait time, the owner writes that Merjuri offers online shopping and in-store pickup— well, I was unaware that I would have to wait in a nearly hour-long line for IN-STORE PICKUP which should take 2 minutes. Its as if Merjuri purposely understaffs the store after the holidays to discourage customers from returning their jewelry or making exchanges. If you dont want to waste your time, I suggest shopping somewhere else where the company actually cares about its customers and customer service.",Los Angeles,1,2022-02-10 00:00:00,Mejuri,2,"8404 Melrose Ave, Los Angeles, CA",CA,Antoinette Monique,

"I never, ever thought Id be buying fine jewelry but Im addicted to Mejuri. Stumbled in here with my best friend about a month ago. I remembered seeing targeted Instagram ads so we decided to check it out. Mejuri makes buying jewelry really fun, exciting and accessible. The designs are modern and great for everyday wear. Ive never been a fan of spending a ton of money on things that are only for occasions and Mejuri does an excellent creating beautiful pieces to add some shine to even the most casual outfits. I have been back a second time to get my 2nd lobe piercing. It was painless and quick AND its exactly the jewelry I want!

"I had long awaited this review. I had been here last november and asked for a flat from a piercer that seemed very nervous, shaky, and didnt even let me get a flat in the end, I left with a helix, that was crooked and never healed.About a month or two ago I had gone back to the location addressing my concern due to the fact that my helix wasnt healing and to begin with its not even what I asked for from the beginning, Modey was my new piecer at Mejuri that day and took such an amazing job of me, she had instantly said yea this needs to be fixed let me see what I can do for you. She ended up being able to fix my piercing with what I ended up wanting, I was a little hesitant at first due to my last experience but then she had really reassured me of her work in the process. Anyways fast foward about a month or two, I am so happy with my piercing! Modey was by far one of the best piercers I have ever been to and I have at least 20 piercings by other people, my flat looks great! and it looks ontrack to get the post downsized soon and be done healing! thank you so much Modey! I owe you the world with my new piercing you gave me!",San Diego,0,2024-09-10 00:00:00,Mejuri,5,"4545 La Jolla Village Dr Suite C-12, San Diego, CA",CA,mia suffredini,

"I love the jewelry but all three piercings I got at Mejuri had to be taken out because they didnt heal properly due to improper piercings. My thirds were both crooked and my helix was pierced not in line with my anatomy so I ended up with it not healed even after two years. On top of that, the $275 piece I purchased for my helix that I was told was solid gold tarnished after a year and a half. I would make sure and go to an APP certified piercer for piercings instead, jewelry quality will be better too.",San Diego,0,2024-10-10 00:00:00,Mejuri,3,"4545 La Jolla Village Dr Suite C-12, San Diego, CA",CA,Sophie Zollman,

"This is hands down, the best place to get your ears pierced. I got my helix and conch pierced back in May and had a lovely experience. I love the flat back and all the piercing options they have that. Youre talking about real gold and real gemstones. No more boring studs that leave you wishing you had something more sparkly. Once they were healed and the swelling went down, I was able to go back in and switch out the posts to something shorter for free! You can also opt for the $30 gold flat back vs titanium. To top off my already great experience, I recently lost the backing to an earring when I was taking off my motorcycle helmet. They again, gave me the new post for free!

"This company is completely fraudulent. When sending in warranty claims theyre getting rejected, even though all of the jewelry has been sent back to the company. The jewelry is falling apart and tarnishing even when it stated that its real metal. No one from the warranty department is getting back to me and these practices are completely untrustworthy.  They have taken back the product without providing a reimbursement or replacement product.   Heres some photos of how the jewelry looked after wearing for a short time.

"Im not one to leave bad reviews, unless I continue experiencing issues at a store I frequent. To be clear, I love Mejuri jewelry and have been a customer since before they had physical stores in Seattle. The issue here seems to be within customer service. Whenever I walk into this store, I always feel like their last priority. They greet everyone else and people who come in after me, and it seems like they avoid asking if I need help. I dont understand it. I worked at Nordstrom in fine jewelry and watches for over 5 years and give a lot of grace because I know that things can get chaotic. Considering the size of this store and the demand for product, it makes sense why they are always busy. This time I tried to make eye contact with one of the associates and they looked at me and then looked away, and greeted another customer that came into the store. I had errands to run so I didnt have makeup on nor did I have a ton of jewelry on, which is not usual for me. I dont want to make extreme assumptions so Ill let management take it from here.

"Its great to be able to see all the jewelry in person, but the purchase experience is nonetheless suboptimal.First, there was a line outside of the store, which was fine because I only waited for 5 minutes.Second, its a little confusing on whether I should hold onto items that Im interested in my shopping basket. Every time when I ask an associate about the price, they always ask are you ready to check out?Last but not least, after I paid for my items, I waited for 10+ minutes for them to fetch the products from the back of the store...",Seattle,3,2023-02-10 00:00:00,Mejuri,3,"2621 NE University Village St, Seattle, WA",WA,K Min,

"The store is beautiful, and it is really nice to see all of the items that they have online in person.However, I didnt have the best experience with the setup towards ear piercing. First, I asked to be contacted when they had a piercer lined up (which the staff said they would do), and was never emailed. Then I signed up for an appointment online, and it was canceled because the piercers schedule wasnt updated online. When I finally got to my appointment, I was told I couldnt get my ears pierced because of a possible keloid scarring issue I may have had on one of my previous piercings although I was willing to take the risk. This was fair, but I feel like this could have been a part of the terms & conditions form I had to sign. Also, the piercer didnt want to do 4 piercings although the website allows up to four in one appointment. The whole thing ends with Mejuri sending me an email on aftercare for piercings that I never received.I feel like there were so many factors that resulted in a not-great in-person experience for me.",Seattle,8,2023-02-10 00:00:00,Mejuri,2,"2621 NE University Village St, Seattle, WA",WA,YeJi An,

She was very patient with us despite how indecisive we were, she offered many different helpful options, and even wrote down what we looked at so that we can come back later to make a final decision. She was honestly the sweetest, and made us feel like we could take our time, finding the right rings for the both of us. Also very knowledgeable on all the products and told us about all the policies. Beautiful store with lots of options, both times that we entered the store, everyone was really friendly.",Bellevue,1,2024-09-10 00:00:00,Mejuri,5,"124 Bellevue Square Unit L124, Bellevue, WA",WA,Alea Camacho,

Awful customer service from manager Alex!Me and my finance were excited about this store coming to Bellevue square and we bought a diamond necklace for her stack. We purchased necklace in store and when we opened it at home it was tangle with several knots. I went back to the store to return the necklace a few days later. The manager Alex told me he did not believe the necklace was sold us like that and that essentially I was lying about how it was sold. He initially was not going to accept the return and was persistent that it was not sold to us like that (which it was). No apology from them selling me a diamond necklace with a knot in it.

"Went into Mejuri on west 4th with my husband today to return a gift he received on Christmas. We both agreed that this store exhibited some of the worst, snooty customer service we have ever experienced. No one acknowledged us as we entered the store and we couldnt distinguish who even worked there. We walked to what seemed like the check out desk and waited patiently. As we waited, the piercing negative energy in this place was unbearable. I cant really explain the feeling other than it felt like we didnt belong there and that we were a burden to be helped. Ive never wanted to leave a business so quickly. As I read other reviews it comforts me to know that this isnt just some figment of my imagination. This store I cant imagine will last long. The jewelry itself isnt even good quality. Ive seen so many resellers of this particular brand on FB Marketplace which only confirms for me that this make is the IKEA brand of jewelry.",Vancouver,1,2025-01-27 00:00:00,Mejuri,1,"2166 W 4th Ave, Vancouver, BC, Canada",BC,Kristyn Webster,
"I had a very bad experience in this Mejuri at W 4th in Vancouver, and Im still dealing with it years later.Two years ago, I got my wedding band at this store. A simple white gold band, with a letter engraved on the inside. Since then, two main problems came from it, leading me to spending a lot more to remedy the issue. Save yourself some trouble and dont buy there. They dont care about customer satisfaction.1. When it was sold to me, I tried different sizes to choose the right one and the customer service rep told me that I could always get it readjusted if the size wasnt right when I got it. When I got it, the size wasnt right so I went back to get it readjusted and they said that was not possible because of the engraving (no one had told me that before). I explained that at the store and they didnt care at all. So, I had to take it to another jeweler and pay extra to get the size adjusted in a rush before my wedding day.2. A few months later, the gold started to yellow and it didnt look like white gold anymore. I took it to the store and they said they couldnt do anything. I then took it to another jeweler and they explained to me that it wasnt fully white gold, but rather white gold plating with yellow gold underneath. This was not said to me when this store sold me the ring. So I had to pay for this other jeweler to re-plate it into white gold.After a few months, the same thing happened again, the gold started to yellow. I had moved away by that point so I took it to another jeweler in my new city and they told me the same, saying that every few months I would have to pay to have it re-plated if I wanted the ring to remain white because the ring was not made from white gold or a gold that could sustain that white gold/silver color I was looking for (and that was sold to me at the store).I would not have bought it if this store was honest about the products it sells; I wanted a white gold ring, and Im stuck with the wrong color.It wasnt cheap either. Save yourself a lot of trouble and avoid Mejuri for your important jewelry needs.",Vancouver,3,2024-11-10 00:00:00,Mejuri,1,"2166 W 4th Ave, Vancouver, BC, Canada",BC,Luisa,
"I recently visited this jewelry shop to purchase a bracelet and earrings. I brought two pictures of the items I was interested in and asked the female staff member to assist me in viewing them in person—one picture was of a bracelet, and the other was of a pair of earrings. However, the earrings she showed me were obviously different from the picture I provided. To make matters worse, the earrings I was asking about are one of their supposed bestsellers, so its baffling that she couldnt recognize them. The bracelet she showed me was also incorrect.When I proceeded to pay for the bracelet, I noticed that the price was different from what I was originally told. This means all the information she provided me was inaccurate. To add insult to injury, when I asked her for assistance in wearing the bracelet, she didnt even look at me or acknowledge me properly. She simply said, ""Okay, Im gonna help you,"" in a dismissive tone, unlocked the bracelet, and handed it to me. I struggled to put it on, and despite standing right next to me, she made no effort to assist.Its hard not to believe that she did this on purpose. Her terrible attitude and lack of professionalism made me feel completely unwelcome in the store. And seriously, how can a staff member not know their best-selling items?This was, without a doubt, the worst customer service experience Ive ever had. I will never return to this shop, and I strongly advise others to take their business elsewhere. There are plenty of other jewelry shops that offer better service, accurate information, and an overall pleasant shopping experience. This store doesnt deserve a single penny of your hard-earned money.",Vancouver,0,2024-12-10 00:00:00,Mejuri,1,"2166 W 4th Ave, Vancouver, BC, Canada",BC,Rika S,
"I ordered some earrings online for black Friday to replace my old hoops. The old hoops completely snapped and pierced through my left ear, causing bleeding. I had asked in stores if Mejuri can replace the broken ones, and they said no. I still decided that with one good hoop from the previous pair left, it was worthy to give the brand another shot during their black friday sale. I went in to pick up my new earrings in stores last weekend - I spoke with a male employee with glasses to ask for help. It is difficult to describe this, but his tone of voice and expressions were rude, as if that I should not have been talking to him, or bothering him. I was told that I cannot pick up my order, because you need to present your photo ID, which I had no idea about. I asked if it would be okay to show them the order receipt and pick-up notification email instead as that is a proof of purchase. They said a cold ""No"", walked a couple of steps away from me, and left me standing at the counter… I looked at them helplessly as they stared at me in judgement and did not provide further customer service or assistance… I was quite taken aback and shocked at this treatment, but did not want to cause a scene and complain.. Moments after, I went to them and asked if I can speak to another staff member, and someone else came out from the back and handled the pick up thereafter.I find the unhelpful attitude and unprofessional initial encounter to be completely unnecessary. I hope the store can properly train their staff to provide bare minimum adequate customer service.Ive been a customer for the brand for quite some time, and going in stores to be treated in a disrespectful manner was very disappointing.",Vancouver,0,2025-01-10 00:00:00,Mejuri,1,"2166 W 4th Ave, Vancouver, BC, Canada",BC,Ellen Jessica,
My sister and I had great service at the Mejuri piercing studio. From the piercing itself to check up! I got my conch done and my sister got her midi back in December and had amazing service! They allowed us to go in together. The studio was beautiful. The piercing area was private and also just as beautiful and very clean. The piercer was so friendly and nice. Made the both of us super comfortable! She explained the process of both piercings and everything in between. We recently went back for a checkup and had a different girl but she was just as lovely. I will be getting any future piercings done at Mejuri. Would definitely recommend to a friend!,Vancouver,1,2024-02-10 00:00:00,Mejuri,5,"2166 W 4th Ave, Vancouver, BC, Canada",BC,Mikayla Vander Helm,
"Edit:Mejuri reached back out to me to offer replacement of the defective cartilage hoop since it was still well within the warranty period.While I understand theyre not a luxury brand, their prices are by no means cheap, so Id expect better customer service from them. I purchased diamond hoops for my cartilage piercing a little over a year ago, which is still within their 2-year warranty period. The clasp on one of the cartilage hoops has been loose, falling off my ear a few times since Ive worn it. Understandably, I was concerned its only a matter of time before I lose it so I reached out to them for a replacement under their warranty which was rejected because apparently they expect me to remove my cartilage hoop everytime before I sleep and before each shower, which is impractical and not a common practice at all for jewelry meant for cartilage, helix, naval piercings. I have the exact same hoop on my other ear which has also been worn since I purchased it and has not fallen off, but they refuse to accept that this one may have been a bit loose from the start (a concern also raised by others in the reviews on the product, which I regret not paying heed to). Ive owned multiple different cartilage earrings over the past couple of decades and have never had this issue before. Please be mindful they dont offer repair for their jewelry which can be quite frustrating as a customer.",Vancouver,0,2024-11-10 00:00:00,Mejuri,3,"2166 W 4th Ave, Vancouver, BC, Canada",BC,Sudipti Katwal,
"I just wanted to express how frustrated I am with Mejuri. My earrings clasp broke in my ear yesterday all of a sudden and Mejuri declined to change the piece as it was outside their 2 year warranty claim. The decision made is honestly outrageous and Im trying hard to understand how you qualify as a proper jeweller if youre unable to provide the below services:- Youre unable to REPAIR what you sell. This is literally in the description of a jeweller, it doesnt even have to be a luxury one as you claim you are.- Youre unable to buy gold which is the funniest thing. You cant even buy back the item that you already sold.- You refuse to renew the item.- Last of all, you dont even sell the earring in singles. The customer is required to buy the item again.I also want to mention that this clasp has been already broken twice and I had to change it in store. Its super flimsy and it really speaks for the quality of your so-called jewelery. Your gold pieces are obviously not cheap and one makes this purchase thinking it would be an heirloom piece, to be used for the years to come, at least I did. I was mistaken!

"1 star because I love the jewelry however the customer service could use some feedback.Upon requesting to purchase a set of earrings, the employee informed me they only had the single earrings in stock. I asked if I could purchase 2 singles for the price of a set as they did not have sets available in store or online. I was informed that they could not do this and as a result I feel this is poor customer service. To build customer clientele it would have been in their best interest to honour the price of a set.Secondly after purchasing a set online I lost one of the earrings which seems to be a common trend in the reviews. I realize this is a method of sales (so customers will purchase singles) however why not make the butterfly backings of good quality? Or perhaps offer alternative backings as well that tend to hold better.Generally speaking I do not find the service great here. It seems as though the employees are too busy chatting amongst themselves.EDIT:contacted customer support in regards to a bday discount code I received via email and accidentally deleted.

I pretty much knew what I wanted when into the store.  The stylist who helped me was a lovely guy and helped me make my decision quickly.

Had a seamless and great experience getting my ears pierced - instructions were carefully relayed and it was relatively painless. Customer service was great and she explained things (especially after care) well. The jewellery is also super dainty and  the styles there are all classic.  Shopping at Mejuri was a great experience overall.,Vancouver,0,2023-02-10 00:00:00,Mejuri,4,"2166 W 4th Ave, Vancouver, BC, Canada",BC,Kyna Ng,
I didnt even wanted to give out that one star! I was in the store just now..wanted a little something for my ears. I was looking at a pair of earrings when the associate rushed towards me and told me the they were $300 something and told me to look at another pair which was $60. Please focus on selling and not humiliating your customers by blatantly telling them about the price which they never asked for. I was having a good day until now.Please consider training the staff better. Its not even real gold.,Vancouver,5,2024-02-10 00:00:00,Mejuri,1,"2166 W 4th Ave, Vancouver, BC, Canada",BC,manpreet kaur,
"I had a few piercings (helix, second lobe, and upper lobe) done at Mejuri a few weeks ago. Very pleasant experience. Piercers are very helpful and gentle. My piercings have been healing well.

"Everything was great except for the exchange policy.  I got some gifts and 2 gift certificates for my birthday,  the gift was too big so I had to do an exchange but they had to refund the whole transaction and charge me again. Luckily, my friend was available on phone and let them recharge the credit card.  Second my friend bought be 2 gcs but the girl was like you cam on use one gc per transaction.  Luckily I had a really smart sales associate that was helping me.  She quickly figured out a way to fix the issue..Hopefully they have updated there system.  Otherwise everything else is fantastic.

"Love the products as I have seen them worn by friends, but extremely unhappy with the customer service at the store on W. 4thCame in last week and it was quite busy. I waited a round until it slowed down and a few staff became available so I could try on some rings. Not once was I asked if I need help, no smiles, no acknowledgement whatsoever.I felt like I was bothering them when asking about prices and sizing.There was one male staff at the time and he was especially unfriendly and unprofessional. He only became nice to my friend who made a few purchases.Considering ordering online but after reading the multiple reviews about Mejuris horrible online service, I am not sure if I should bother anymore.",Vancouver,5,2024-02-10 00:00:00,Mejuri,1,"2166 W 4th Ave, Vancouver, BC, Canada",BC,H.

"I had an excellent experience getting my lobes pierced in February (second holes). The piercing healed quickly and although it was expensive (minimum $75/earring+$25 piercing fee), I thought the quality of the earrings made it worth it. They pierce with threadless flat back earrings that are long to account for swelling and offer a free downsize after ~2 months after healing. When I was ready to downsize, I was notified that due to stock issues they did not have the shorter backs and it would be 2 weeks until they got them in. It has now been a month and I have still not been contacted about when they will be arriving. Once healed, the long backs get caught in everything and actually reopen the hole which is quite painful and can increase risk of infection. I finally have given up and bought my own short backs from a different company.  I also didnt realize the upgrade to the short backs is titanium not gold, so the cost of the earrings is really only for the very small front part of the earring. Im sure they will keep piercing and keep experiencing stock shortages forcing people to purchase their own backs or the Mejuri gold ones ($70) instead of the free downsize. After all of this, I dont think the cost of the earrings is worth it and the customer service I received has been pretty bad.",Vancouver,4,2024-02-10 00:00:00,Mejuri,2,"2166 W 4th Ave, Vancouver, BC, Canada",BC,Megan,
"Booked a piercing appointment on a Sunday and overall had a wonderful experience.

"I got two pieces being so excited few months back and now they are all turning black. It shows that the quality of jewellery does not reflect that price. Please dont waste your money on here. I emailed them, they never bothered to reply back. I went down to the store and they said ' oh you kept inside the box,  thats why it has turned black and we cant do anything. I hardly wore these pieces. The store manager was so rude and did not bother to even address the issue.

"I am giving zero star to the customer service and the experience I had in the Vancouver store today. I had ordered 2 items online and went to pick them up at the store. After trying the ring I decided to exchange it with another ring. Waited 1 hr in the store for this simple exchange and after the sale person made several errors with the transactions, I asked to see the manager. Unfortunately, the manager was really rude and although she knew that the sale person had mistaken several times, she didnt even apologize. Now that I have checking my credit card, I see that I have been charged $430 for the two items that were supposed to be $140! I am just hoping that the multiple refunds she did are gonna show up. This was my first and my last time to buy anything from Mejuri.

"Used to be a long-time supporter of the brand but will never shop here ever again. Management will tell you lies just to scam you into going into the store again and not honour what they promised.Also warning - not only is packaging inconsistent, be sure to check that you have all your items. I ordered a 14k gold necklace and only the pendant came, not the necklace itself (website clearly shows it comes with both). Had to argue with customer service and almost break open every part of the packaging to prove to them they did not send me the item as advertised when it was clearly their mistake in the first place.

I found that the brands gold 14k jewelry caused allergies for people like me who are sensitive to other materials.Its important to note that these products should not come into contact with water.Reply to Mejuri:I had great experience there with your very professional and supportive team 👌🏻I just mentioned the problem for those who have allergies like me as I had to return all my purchases cuz of that,Vancouver,0,2024-02-10 00:00:00,Mejuri,3,"2166 W 4th Ave, Vancouver, BC, Canada",BC,Azi Jahan,
Sharing this review based so far on customer experience. Will adjust if they are able to address my concern. Paid for the express shipping - as stated in their website 1-2 business days. My expected ship date does not fall within the provided time (even excluding the date of purchase to fill the order need before shipping).Edit:Customer service has not responded to my inquiry about the shipping delay.

"Service was friendly and they were able to accomodate an exchange outside of the typical return period. However, I needed to decide where to ship a package. We were told the replacement item would not ship for over a week and used this information to decide where to ship the replacement item. However, the package shipped the next day instead. I tried contacting both the shipping company and Mejuri customer service to hold the package but unfortunately could not get through to the shipping company and Mejuri customer service was unhelpful in resolving this issue. Managers need to inform their workers of the correct shipping times to tell customers. Now nobody is at the location to claim the $200 parcel and there is nobody to help",Vancouver,2,2023-02-10 00:00:00,Mejuri,1,"2166 W 4th Ave, Vancouver, BC, Canada",BC,Melina,
"Cancelling online order is almost impossible.I ordered 2 instead of 1 diamond necklace by mistake. I realized that 5 minutes later and tried contacting them via the chat to cancel half of my order. I got connected finally and was told that they were unable to cancel because the order was already fulfilled, despite I had only ordered 5 mins prior. I had no choice but to request a free return, which was fine but I unfortunately lost connection and my chat was closed only after 5 minutes of not responding. I had to go through the whole process to get connected to the chat just to request a free return. Basically, their process makes it difficult to cancel any order by mistake and their customer service isnt the most helpful.

"Bought a pair of 14K gold hoop earrings ($784 including tax)  online for my daughter and she was happy with it. No issue.I decided to place another order online for 2 bracelets and earrings that came to $656.32, but changed my mind and immediately tried to cancel. At first, they wouldnt let me cancel the order and I was told that they cannot cancel if its already being processed by their fulfillment team. I placed the order on Sept 28th and it wasnt shipping until Oct. 4th. I thought it was absurd that I couldnt cancel an order I placed on the same day. Worse, to be told they couldnt do anything about it. I said if they go ahead with the order that I would just contact my bank and dispute the charge. The sales rep replied back and said she was allowed to make an exception and that I was going to get a refund back within 5-10 business days.Long story short, yesterday was October 12th and I still have not received my refund after ten business days.  I contacted my bank and proceeded to dispute the charge.I canceled my order the same day I placed it and yet my card was still charged and no product was sent. THAT IS CALLED FRAUD!!!

I asked for resizing it or for a return and they refused because the ring is engraved.

"I used to love buying from Mejuri online, and was very excited when this store opened so I could shop in person. As other reviews reflect, my experience when the store first opened was uncomfortable and chaotic. But! I thought Id give them another shot since theyve been open a year now.Same creepy and cold atmosphere. This is another cashless (so, classist) store. Want to know the price? A rep has to look it up on their website with an ipad. Want to buy? Take your credit card, enter allll the info in on their website manually (yes, were still at their physical store), and wait for someone to pack your order in the back. Why shop online when you can shop online while standing in the store?

"This is the first google review I have ever written. Something Ive only been compelled to do after my experience with Mejuri. If I could give Mejuri 0 stars I would. This review is not about this store, but rather Mejuris online store. If youre looking to purchase anything online from them, DO NOT. Its currently December 19th and I still have no idea where my item I purchased on November 22nd is. Its been almost a month and Ive missed my wedding anniversary. Ive reached out to Mejuri several times online but theve done little to nothing to resolve the issue. I even asked to have my order cancelled yesterday and be issued a refund which they said they cant do. When I originally purchased my order from their website, I did so with their shipping guidelines in mind, which clearly is not accurate. I strongly suggest looking elsewhere before buying anything online from Mejuri.

I visited the store 10 minutes before closing but the sales associates were kind enough to show me pieces I was interested in and help with my purchase without rushing me out.It seems that there are some negative reviews from when the store launched. I recall the long lineups but dont think theyre an accurate reflection of the store. Im glad to be able to see the products in person and will certainly revisit.,Vancouver,2,2023-02-10 00:00:00,Mejuri,5,"2166 W 4th Ave, Vancouver, BC, Canada",BC,Ali Mahad,

"Most of the employees are more concerned with chatting to each other than actually helping the customer. I had to ask the worker if she was working because she barely acknowledged me. Had to ask for help and try things on, she then randomly left me to myself? Saw her in a diff area of the store casually talking with a coworker so I was left to stand around until someone helped me check out.

"Would give 0 stars if I could.I had a terrible experience at Mejuri. The sales associates were not attentive and they were extremely unfriendly. When you dont display prices, its expected that staff will be more engaging and provide you with all the product details —but that was not the case. I asked for prices of a few items, and the associate kept giving me rough estimates with annoyed expressions, as though I was wasting her time.When I asked for the price of a ring, she told me its around 50 and when I asked if that was before or after the discount, she simply told me, there is no discount on that, without asking how much I was planning to spend. The promotion was that you had spend over $150 to get discount. I had already set aside other items and would have easily qualified for the discount, but they didnt bother to offer any information and just assumed that i wont be getting a discount lolThe only friendly person with a smile was a guy who assisted me briefly, but even he kept walking away and disappearing in the back even as I was paying, which felt very unprofessional. It was clear that they werent interested in providing any kind of real service.I came in with intentions to buy multiple pieces, but after the poor customer service, I decided to leave with just one item—one I already knew the exact price of because I looked online.Jewelry stores used to offer a luxury experience, but at Mejuri, the associates attitudes reflect the same lack of quality Ive experienced with their jewelry.I wont be returning.",West Vancouver,3,2024-12-10 00:00:00,Mejuri,1,"925 Main St Unit H3, West Vancouver, BC, Canada",BC,Sana Pierre,

"The sales associate was not at all familiar with products and pricing and told me that there was nothing in my budget of up to $150. I asked for pricing on a bracelet I was interested in and was told that the gemstone was a real diamond and therefore not in my budget. Ive since looked up the bracelet online and see its a topaz gemstone and the bracelet goes for $98. I also see another bracelet for $118 that was right next to the topaz one in store, and yet he told me theres nothing in the store in my price range. Ive shopped at Majuri before and have certainly seen items within $150, but with his lack of help and smug comment to brush me off, he made me feel like I wasnt ""good enough"" to help since I clearly cant afford to shop there. What is now clear to me is his lack of any product knowledge and his immense unprofessionalism. If the products at Mejuri are priced as high as he says, then perhaps their sales associates should learn more about them and care for the customers purchasing these ""big ticket items"". It was a very disappointing experience.",West Vancouver,1,2025-01-10 00:00:00,Mejuri,1,"925 Main St Unit H3, West Vancouver, BC, Canada",BC,Amanda Boland,

The store was nowhere near busy but I could not seem to get sized to purchase the rings I was interested in. I specifically came because I received an email about a members sale I wanted to take advantage of, but ended up leaving empty handed and never to enter this store again.

They were sold out of one option I had wanted but online you can check stock so I will keep checking that. Prices are fair and jewelry is pretty. Good options between gold vermeil (plated) and solid gold. IMO it is worth the extra price for the solid gold, and their solid pieces are not too much more than the plated.
