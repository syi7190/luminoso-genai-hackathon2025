The customer was shocked and unimpressed with the treatment received at the jewelry store. Despite intending to purchase, they were ignored upon entry and had to seek assistance. The employee they spoke with was condescending about pricing, making assumptions about their ability to afford the jewelry. This poor customer service experience spoiled the purchase, leading them to consider online shopping or alternative local jewelers in the future. They only gave one star despite liking the earrings due to the bad customer service.
